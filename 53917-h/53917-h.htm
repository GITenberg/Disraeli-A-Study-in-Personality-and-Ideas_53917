<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> power of imagination is essential to supreme statesmanship.
Indeed, no really originative genius in any
domain of the mind can succeed without it. In
literature it reigns paramount. Of art it is the soul.
Without it the historian is a mere registrar of sequence, and
no interpreter of characters. In science it decides the end
towards which the daring of a Verulam, a Newton, a Herschel,
a Darwin, can travel. On the battle-field, in both
elements, it enabled Marlborough, Nelson, and Napoleon to
revolutionise tactics. In the law its influence is perhaps less
evident; but even here a masterful insight into the spirit of
precedent marks the creative judge. By lasting imagination,
far more than by the colder weapon of shifting reason, the
world is governed. “Even Mormon,” wrote Disraeli, “counts
more votaries than Bentham.” For imagination is a vivid,
intellectual, half-spiritual sympathy, which diverts the flood of
human passion into fresh channels to fertilise the soil; just
as fancy again is the play of intellectual emotion. Whereas
reason, the measure of which varies from age to age, can
only at best dam or curb the deluge for a time. Reason
educates and criticises, but Imagination inspires and creates.
The magnetic force which is felt is really the spell of personal
influence and the key of public opinion. It solves problems
by visualising them, and kindles enthusiasm from its own
fascinating fires. And more: Imagination is in the truest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
sense prophetic. Could one only grasp with a perfect view
the myriad provinces of suffering, enterprise, and aspiration
with which the Leader is called upon to grapple, not only
would the expedients to meet them suggest themselves as
by a divine flash, but their inevitable relations and meanings
would start into vision. For what the herd call the Present,
is only the <em>literal</em> fact, the shell, of environment. Its <em>spirit</em> is
the Future; and the highest imagination in seeing it foresees.
Imagination, once more, is the mainspring of spontaneity.
Its vigour enables the will to beget circumstance, instead of
being the creature of surroundings; “for Imagination ever
precedeth voluntary motion,” says Bacon. It empowers the
will of one to sway and mould the wills of many. And it is
the very source of that capacity for idealism which alone distinguishes
man from the brute. Viewing in 1870 the general
purport of his message, Disraeli wrote with truth that it
“... ran counter to the views which had long been prevalent
in England, and which may be popularly, though not
altogether accurately, described as utilitarian;” that it
“recognised imagination in the government of nations as a
quality not less important than reason;” that it “trusted to a
popular sentiment which rested on an heroic tradition, and
was sustained by the high spirit of a free aristocracy;” that
its “economical principles were not unsound,” but that it
“looked upon the health and knowledge of the multitude as
not the least precious part of the wealth of nations;” that “in
asserting the doctrine of race,” it “was entirely opposed to
the equality of man, and similar abstract dogmas, which have
destroyed ancient society without creating a satisfactory substitute;”
that “resting on popular sympathies and popular
privileges,” it “held that no society could be durable unless it
was built upon the principles of loyalty and religious reverence.”</p>

<p>How comes it, then, that, in the art of governing a free
people, this imaginative fellowship with unseen ideas, this
power which men call Genius, “to make the passing shadow
serve thy will,” is so constantly suspected and mistrusted;
that <em>un</em>common sense, until it triumphs, is a stone of stumbling
to the common sense of the average man? That
Cromwell was called a self-seeking maniac for his vision of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Theocracy; William of Orange, a cold-blooded monster for
his quest after union and empire; Bolingbroke, a charlatan
for his fight against class-preponderance, and on behalf of
united nationality; Chatham, an actor for his dramatic disdain
of shams; Canning, by turns a charlatan and buffoon,
for preferring the traditions of a popular crown to the innovations
of a crowned democracy, and at the same time
seeking to break the charmed circle of a patrician syndicate;
that Burke was hounded out by jealous oligarchs for refusing
to confound the “nation” with the “people,” and cosmopolitan
opinions with national principles? The main answer
is simple. What is above the moment is feared by it, and
malice is the armour of fear: “It is the abject property of
most that being parcel of the common mass, and destitute of
means to raise themselves, they sink and settle lower than
they need. They know not what it is to feel within a comprehensive
faculty that grasps great purposes with ease, that
turns and wields almost without an effort plans too vast for
their conception, which they cannot move;” and there are

<p class="in0">There are the puzzled whom novelty bewilders, and there
are the cautious who suspect it. And there is the wholesome
instinct of the plain majority to pin itself to immediate
“measures” without recognising that a “principle” may change
expedients for bringing its idea into effect. Again, there
are many—especially in England—who, in their genuine
scorn of pinchbeck, mistake the great for the grandiose, and
certain that nothing which glitters can be gold, invest
imaginative brilliance with the tinsel spangles of Harlequin.
There are, too, the second-rate and the second-hand,
whose life is one long quotation, and who doubt every
coin unissued from the nearest mint; and there is, moreover,
a sort of stolid crassness readily dignified into sterling
solidity. All this is natural. Institutions and traditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
themselves have been aliens until naturalised in and by the
community. Imagination gave them birth, national needs
accept them; and the contemporary sneer is often succeeded
by the posthumous statue.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most curious feature of the prosaic and imperceptive
man is his ready confusion of the dramatic with
the theatrical, of attitude with posture, of pointed effects
for a big purpose with affectations for a small. Flirtation
might just as well be confounded with love, or foppery with
breeding. And yet these same unimaginative censors have
often contradicted their protests by their actions, and squandered
great opportunities by futile strokes of the theatre.</p>

<p>So early as 1837, Sheil, who from the first admired the
young Disraeli (then Bulwer’s intimate and the meteor of
three seasons), whom Disraeli praised in one of his earliest
election speeches, and who was surely no mean judge of intellectual
eloquence, warned him after his <i>début</i> that “the
House will not allow a man to be a wit and an orator, unless
they have the credit of finding it out.... You have shown
the House that you have a fine organ, that you have an
unlimited command of language, that you have courage,
temper, and readiness. Now get rid of your genius for a
session; speak often, for you must not show yourself cowed,
but speak shortly. Be very quiet, try to be dull, only argue
and reason imperfectly, for if you reason with precision, they
will think you are trying to be witty. Astonish them by
speaking on subjects of detail. Quote figures, dates, calculations,
and in a short time the House will sigh for the wit
and eloquence which they all know are in you; they will
encourage you to pour them forth, and then you will have
the ear of the House, and be a favourite.” Seventeen years
afterwards, when the dashing <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">littérateur</i> had become Chancellor
of the Exchequer and leader of the House of Commons,
Mr. Walpole thus defended him against his enemies on the
Budget. “... Whence is it that these extraordinary attacks
are made against my right honourable friend? What is the
reason, what is the cause, that he is to be assailed at every
point, when he has made two financial statements in one
year, which have both met with the approbation of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
House, and I believe also with the approbation of the
country? Is it because he has laboured hard and long,
contending with genius against rank and power and the ablest
statesmen, until he has attained the highest eminence which
an honourable ambition may ever aspire to—the leadership
and guidance of the Commons of England? Is it because he
has verified in himself the dignified description of a great
philosophical poet of antiquity, portraying equally his past
career and his present <span class="locked">position—</span></p>

<p>Yes! This is the sort of barrier piled in the path of the
brilliant by the “practical” man—“the man who practises the
blunders of his predecessors,” the “prophet of the past.” Still
greater, because deeper laid, are the obstacles which confront
him when he has mastered the drudgery of office and the
strategy of debate; when, from the vantage-ground of political
pre-eminence and public approval, he dares to look over the
heads of his compeers and prepare strong foundations for
the future of his country. Then that becomes true which
Bolingbroke has so splendidly expressed: “The ocean which
environs us is an emblem of our government, and the pilot
and the minister are in similar circumstances. It seldom
happens that either of them can steer a direct course, and
they both arrive at their port by means which frequently
seem to carry them from it. But as the work advances, the
conduct of him who leads it on with real abilities clears up,
the appearing inconsistencies are reconciled, and when it is
once consummated, the whole shows itself so uniform, so plain,
and so natural, that every dabbler in politics will be apt to
think that he could have done the same.”</p>

<p>It is this that Disraeli effected by reverting to fundamental
elements and substituting the generous, inclusive, and
“national” Toryism of Bolingbroke, Wyndham, and Pitt, for
the perverted Toryism of Eldon; the “party without principles,”
the “Tory men and Whig measures,” the “organised
hypocrisy” that followed on the “Tamworth Manifesto;” the
Conservatism that “preserved” institutions as men “preserve”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
game, only to kill them; and the outworn Whiggism that
excluded all but a few governing families from power; and,
after its great achievement of religious liberty, exploited the
extension of civil privileges as the mere muniment of its
own title. He ended the confederacies and revived the creed.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
He repudiated the system under which “the Crown had
become a cipher, the Church a sect, the nobility drones, and
the people drudges.” “... But we forget,” he urges in <cite>Sybil</cite>,
“Sir Robert Peel is not the leader of the Tory party—the
party that resisted the ruinous mystification that metamorphosed
direct taxation by the Crown into indirect taxation
by the Commons; that denounced the system which mortgaged
industry to protect property;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> the party that ruled
Ireland by a scheme which reconciled both Churches, and by
a series of parliaments which counted among them lords and
commons of both religions; that has maintained at all times
the territorial constitution of England as the only basis and
security for local government, and which nevertheless once laid
on the table of the House of Commons a commercial tariff
negotiated at Utrecht, which is the most rational that was ever
devised by statesmen; a party that has prevented the Church
from being the salaried agent of the State, and has supported
the parochial polity of the country which secures to every
labourer a home. In a parliamentary sense that great party
has ceased to exist; but I will believe that it still lives in
the thought and sentiment ... of the English nation. It
has its origin in great principles and noble instincts; it
sympathises with the lowly, it looks up to the Most High;
it can count its heroes and its martyrs.... Even now, ...
in an age of political materialism, of confused purposes and
perplexed intelligence, that aspires only to wealth because it
has faith in no other accomplishment;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> as men rifle cargoes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
on the verge of shipwreck, Toryism will yet rise from the
tomb ... <em>to bring back strength to the Crown, liberty to the
subject, and to announce that power has only one duty—to secure
the social welfare of the people</em>.”</p>

<p>And, again, this from the close of <cite>Coningsby</cite>: “... he
looked upon a government without distinct principles of
policy as only a stop-gap to a widespread and demoralising
anarchy; ... he for one could not comprehend how a free
government could endure without national opinions to uphold
it.... As for Conservative government, the natural question
was, ‘What do you mean to conserve?... Things or only
names, realities or merely appearances? Do you mean to
continue the system commenced in 1834, and with a hypocritical
reverence for the principles and a superstitious
adherence to the forms of the old <em>exclusive</em> constitution,
carry on your policy by latitudinarian practice?’”</p>

<p>His lifelong purpose as a statesman was to refresh institutions
with reality, and to show by practice, as well as by
precept, that, in all classes, an aristocracy without inherent
superiority is doomed. De Tocqueville, in his famous treatise
on “The Old Régime and the Revolution,” does the same.</p>

<p>Eighteenth-century Toryism, a smitten cause espousing
popular privileges, taught that unless the Crown ruled for the
people as well as reigned over them, unless the nobles led
them independently to high issues, unless the people themselves
recognised that they were the privileged order in a
nation, and that their representatives should form “a senate
supported by the sympathy of millions,” the traditional principles
of England had dwindled into a sham.</p>

<p>“No one,” says Disraeli in <cite>Coningsby</cite>, again adverting to
the critical issues of 1834, “had arisen either in Parliament,
the Universities, or the Press, to lead the public mind to the
investigation of principles; and not to mistake in their
reformations the corruption of practice for fundamental ideas.
It was this perplexed, ill-informed, jaded, shallow generation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
repeating cries which they did not comprehend, and wearied
with the endless ebullitions of their own barren conceit, that
Sir Robert Peel was summoned to govern. It was from such
materials, ample in quantity, but in all spiritual qualities most
deficient; with great numbers, largely acred, consoled up to
their chins, but without knowledge, genius, thought, truth, or
faith, that Sir Robert Peel was to form ‘a great Conservative
party on a comprehensive basis....’” Even Sir Robert’s
single-mindedness and supremacy over Parliament failed to
secure strength of Government. By universal consent, including
his own avowal, he wrecked a great party in a country
where great parties form the main pledge for the due representation
of political opinion, and under a system where they
remain the chief preventive against public corruption.</p>

<p>The first two Georges had reigned over the towns, but not
over the country. After the Reform Bill it seemed as though
the great cities themselves would swamp the land. How was
Sir Robert to save the situation in 1834? Speaking with
respect for Sir Robert, but with contempt for his “Tamworth
Manifesto,” Disraeli, in his discussion of that famous document,
repeats his message once more: “... There was indeed
considerable shouting about what they called Conservative
principles; but the awkward question naturally arose, ‘What
will you conserve?’ The prerogatives of a Crown, provided
they are not exercised; the independence of the House of
Lords, provided it is not asserted; the ecclesiastical estate,
provided it is regulated by a commission of laymen. Everything,
in short, that is established, as long as it is a phrase
and not a fact.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>It is thus that the man of ideas is, in the long run,
eminently practical; and it is thus, too, that in the realm of
art ideas are the surest realities. But here also the immediate
appeal constantly falls to the lot of what is called “realism,”
and few feel what they cannot touch until the popular voice
tells them that it is “real.” “Madame,” says Heine in his
“Buch Legrand,” “have you the ghost of an idea what an
idea is? ‘I have put my best ideas into this coat,’ says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
my tailor. My washerwoman says the parson has filled her
daughter’s head with ideas, and unfitted her for anything
sensible; and coachman Pattensen mumbles on every occasion,
‘That is an idea.’ But yesterday, when I inquired
what he meant, he snarled out, ‘An idea is just an idea; it
is any silly stuff that comes into one’s head.’”</p>

<p>No memorial of Disraeli’s magical career can be adequate
without access to the papers confided to the late Lord Rowton,
as well as to much private and unpublished correspondence.
It is no slur on the “Lives” that have already appeared
to say that they lack the materials for a complete picture.
The best of these beyond question is Mr. Froude’s; but not
only is it tinged with considerable prejudice, but it is very
faulty in its facts; and, moreover, in common with Mr. Bryce’s
cursory essay and Herr Brandes’s minuter study, it has
perhaps fallen into the error of misreading Disraeli’s mature
character and career from isolated and indiscriminate use of
such sidelights as they are pleased to discover in his earliest
novels. To trace Disraeli’s development, it is necessary to
follow the long and continuous thread of his words and actions,
to consider the changes experienced during the fifty years of
his political outlook in England and in Europe, and to ascertain
how many of these tendencies were foreseen, produced,
or modified by him. The criticisms current are either those
of men (often partisans) who lack this length of view, and
interpret the latter manifestations of Disraeli’s genius, with
which alone they are even outwardly acquainted, in the light
of preconceived notions, or the few circulated comparatively
early in his career, before its eventual drift was revealed, and
while the full blaze of hostile bitterness was raging. There
exists, it is true, a most able, a most appreciative, a most
detailed account of his political career, compiled by Mr.
Ewald shortly after Lord Beaconsfield’s death, but this is
mainly a long parliamentary chronicle. Mr. Kebbel’s enlightening
edition of selected speeches is illustrative though
limited. To both of these, among many other sources, direct
and indirect, I here gratefully acknowledge my obligation.</p>

<p>A real biography, therefore, is at present impossible.
Disraeli’s acknowledged debt to his darling sister and devoted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
wife (“Women,” he has said, “are the priestesses of pre-destination”);
his correspondence and commerce with many
eminent men, including both Louis Philippe and Napoleon
III.; his letters to our late Queen; his notes of policy; the
rough drafts for compositions, both literary and parliamentary;
his State papers and official memoranda; his relations to
many men of letters and leading; such known, though unpublished,
correspondence as even that with Mrs. Williams;
the glimpses of him as a youth through Mrs. Austin, Bulwer,
Lord Strangford, the Sheridans, with many others; in his
age, through a privileged circle of distinguished and devoted
associates—all these, and many more, must be pressed into
service if even the rudiments are to be portrayed. And none
of these are yet available.</p>

<p>I have therefore thought that, pending such an enterprise,
some account, however imperfect, of the ideas that governed
him throughout—a slight biography, as it were, of his mind—might
prove acceptable. It will endeavour to depict the
spirit of his attitude to the world in which he moved and for
which he worked. It will aim at representing the temperature
of his opinions immanent alike in his writings and speeches.
His utterance was never bounded by the mere occasion, and
light and guidance may be found in it for the problems of
to-day. In most that he wrote or said, a certain swell of soul,
a sweep and stretch of mind are strikingly manifest.</p>

<p>“How very seldom,” he has written, “do you encounter in
the world a man of great abilities, acquirements, experience,
who will unmask his mind, <em>unbutton his brains</em>, and pour forth
in careless and picturesque phrase all the results of his studies
and observations, his knowledge of men, books, and nature!”</p>

<p>Such a contribution is anyhow feasible, and is fraught with
more than even the glamour linked with the person by whom
these ideas were clothed in words and deeds. For principles
are applied ideas; habits are applied principles. Disraeli’s
ideas have, to some extent, become ruling principles,
several of them are at this moment national habits; while
some of them, unachieved during his lifetime, seem in process
of accomplishment. Disraeli was a poet—one of those “unacknowledged
legislators of the world” described by “Herbert”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
in <cite>Venetia</cite>; but his imaginative fancy was allied to a very
strong character. It is a rare combination. To Bolingbroke’s
youthful genius he united that force of will and purpose for
which Bolingbroke had long to wait, and which, perhaps, he
never fully attained. This analogy was pressed on Disraeli
on the threshold of his career by a distinguished friend.</p>

<p>Above all things Disraeli was a personality. Personality
is independent of training, except in the rare cases where
education accords with predisposition. It is the will. And
in authorship, when expression chimes with intention, it is the
style. Personality is the clue to history, for events proceed
from character, more than character from events. Commenting
on the adoption of the “Charter” by non-chartists groaning
under the injustice of industrial slavery, Disraeli observes
most truly: “... But all this had been brought about, as
most of the great events of history, by the unexpected and
unobserved influence of individual character.” Personality is
the salt of politics; it is the spirit of our party system; and
woe betide every era in England when figure-heads replace
head-figures. It is an atmosphere enchanting the landscape.
“... It is the personal that interests mankind, that
fires their imagination and wins their hearts. A cause is a
great abstraction, and fit only for students: embodied in a
party, it stirs men to action; but place at the head of that
party a leader who can inspire enthusiasm, he commands the
world....” Association, groups, co-operative principles,
these are the mechanisms invented by the brain, and guided
by the hand of individuality, the fuel that individuality
gathers and enkindles. Without it they remain dead
lumber, and can never of themselves prove originative forces.
What men crave is, once more in Disraeli’s parlance, “... A
primordial and creative mind; one that will say to his fellows,
‘Behold, God has given me thought, I have discovered truth,
and you <em>shall</em> believe.’” Personality is the contradiction of
the mechanical and of the dead level; it is the soul of
influence. How depressing is the reverse side of the medal!—“Duncan
Macmorrogh” (the utilitarian in <em>The Young Duke</em>),
“cut up the Creation and got a name. His attack upon
mountains was most violent, and proved, by its personality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
that he had come from the lowlands. He demonstrated the
inability of all elevation, and declared that the Andes were
the aristocracy of the globe. Rivers he rather patronised,
but flowers he quite pulled to pieces, and proved them to be
the most useless of existences.... He informed us that we
were quite wrong in supposing ourselves to be the miracle of
the Creation. On the contrary, he avowed that already there
were various pieces of machinery of far more importance than
man; and he had no doubt in time that a superior race would
arise, got by a steam-engine on a spinning-jenny....”</p>

<p>To impress his ideas through his will on his generation,
was Disraeli’s ruling purpose from the first; but to attain the
position which would entitle him to do so he never regarded
as more than a ladder towards his main ambition. Ambition<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
spurred him from the first. But, as the present Duke of
Devonshire generously owned in the heat of party contest,
Disraeli was never prompted by mean or unworthy motives;
and—added the speaker—it would be the merest cant to
pretend that honourable and honest ambition is not a main
incitement to public life. At the outset he was convinced
of a mission, and the visions over which he had long brooded
in silent solitude became realised in the world of action.
Both reverie and energy alternated even in his boyish being.
“I fully believed myself the object of an omnipotent Destiny
over which I had no control”—and yet “Destiny bears us
to our lot, and Destiny is perhaps our own will.” “... There
arose in my mind a desire to create things beautiful as that
golden star;” and yet “... Nor could I conceive that
anything could tempt me from my solitude ... but the
strong conviction that the fortunes of my race depended
on my effort, or that I could materially forward that great
amelioration, ... in the practicability of which I devoutly
believe.” As a boy he dreamed of “shaking thrones and
founding empires;” and yet, he felt that he must not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
“pass” his “days like a ghost gliding in a vision.” These
are among the echoes and glimpses afforded by his earliest
fiction of his earliest self, and to this topic I shall recur in my
last chapter. I mention them here for a material reason. In
treating his thoughts we must distinguish between those
notions which merely concern success or career, and those
ideas which assured victory was to achieve. Nor should we
omit the very vital distinction between personality and egotism,
for confusion in this regard constantly obscures our
estimates. Individuality with the forces that make for it is
not “individualism;” yet the two are often confused.</p>

<p>The essential egotist is a sort of buccaneer. He roams
the seas to rifle cargoes, and his conquests are the spoils of
a freebooter. He seeks to exploit society for his own benefit—to
burn down his neighbour’s roof-tree that he may boil
his egg. He gives nothing that he can keep, and takes all
he can grasp by whatever methods may advantage him. He
leaves the world poorer when he goes, and as he leaves it,
he wishes it. In Cowper’s <span class="locked">words—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Cruel is all he does. ’Tis quenchless thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ruinous ebriety that prompts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His every action, and imbrutes the man.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The man, on the other hand, of overwhelming personality,
aspires honourably to power, the very condition of which in
his eyes is to guide and elevate the country which entrusts
him with it. The responsibility of privilege, great position on
the tenure of great duties, ambition not as a right but as the
sole means of enforcing his ideals—these are his characteristics.
He never covets place without power, and never power
without influence; whereas some kind of covetousness is
essential to the egotist. “He who has great honours,”
Disraeli has urged, “must have great burdens.” And again:
“... My conception,” he said, in a signal speech during 1846,
“of a great statesman is of one who represents a great idea;
an idea which he may and can impress on the mind and
conscience of a nation.... That is a grand, that is indeed
an heroic position. But I care not what may be the position
of a man who never originates an idea—a watcher of the
atmosphere, a man who ... takes his observations, and when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
he finds the wind in a certain quarter trims to suit it. Such a
person may be a powerful Minister, but he is no more a great
statesman than the man who gets up behind a carriage is a
great whip. Both are disciples of progress; both perhaps
may get a good place. But how far the original momentum
is indebted to their powers, and how far their guiding
prudence regulates the lash or the rein, it is not necessary
for me to notice.”</p>

<p>Disraeli never stooped to trim; he always aspired to
steer. When he started as a brilliant author, electric with
ideas derided but since accepted—as an imaginative originator,
“full of deep passions and deep thoughts”—it would
have been easy for him to have followed the triumphal car
of the Whigs who invited him.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> It would have been easy for
him to have suited himself to Sir Robert Peel’s vicissitudes of
private, and desertion of public opinion, embodied in a great
party which had raised him to power. In obeying again the
central ideas which quickened him from the first, Disraeli broke
up the “Young England” party, which looked up to and
cheered him, whose main objects he inspired, and eventually
realised. And in 1867, as we shall see, so far from “dishing”
the Liberals with their own measure of Reform, he carried, in
the teeth of his own supporters, one on lines peculiar to his
own perpetual view of the subject, and at length achieved
what he had urged in the ’thirties, the ’forties, and the ’fifties.</p>

<p>In the stubborn pursuit of his aims Disraeli even courted
unpopularity. On every occasion when the object of the Jew
bill was involved with other measures which he considered
prejudical to its due interests, he risked misconstruction by
withholding his vote. During the long spell of 1859–66,
when a dispirited, and sometimes disloyal following often left
him alone in his seat, he continued the pronouncements alike
and the reticence which they disrelished. During the six
years previous he dared to offend them equally by hammering
the Government’s foreign policy, and insisting on his own
convictions. Nobody, again, more regretted the precipitancy
of Lord Derby in 1852, although his rash assumption of office<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
afforded Disraeli his first hard-won opportunity of leadership.
During three separate sets of discreditable intrigues to dethrone
him, he kept place, counsel, and temper without wheedling concessions
or recriminating revenges, though none could strike
home harder when he chose.</p>

<p>“... Ah, why should such enthusiasm ever die? Life is
too short to be little. Man is never so manly as when he
feels deeply, acts boldly, and expresses himself with frankness
and with fervour.”</p>

<p>The fact that both the mere egotist, and the man of
intense personality, must, from the need of their respectively
low and lofty concentrations, be self-centred, and infuse their
temperaments into the objects of their energy, favours, it is
true, the mistake to which I have referred. But the one is
pettily fixed on self, the other intent on ideals. He leads a
life of ideas which form his atmosphere, and which emanate
from it. He mounts the chariot to drive it to a distant goal,
while the other borrows or pilfers it for his own immediate
convenience. Egoism—if I may coin a distinction—is one
thing, egotism another. Goethe was an egoist—he is full of
a radiating self; but such egoism is, if we reflect, the very
opposite of the egotist, who is full of a shrivelled selfishness.
Such were the later phases of Napoleon, who changed from a
generous imparter into an absorbing monopolist. That was
egotism. All genius, however, has been egoist, and ever will
be; for genius is at once the ear, sensitive to the subtlest
appeals of existence, and the voice which constrains others
to enter the realm of its ideas. Its sensitiveness is part of
its strength, and in this respect it shares the self-consciousness
of the artist. It is in the real sense auto-suggestive; it
implants ideas which its will generates into events. It is in
some degree <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Genius is both light and heat; it combines enthusiasm
with insight. Such a genius was Disraeli. He was eminently
a man of ideas, and not merely of abnormal perceptions.
This distinction again is material, and too often ignored.</p>

<p>The eminently perceptive man is at root a critic, while
the man of ideas is by prerogative a creator; and yet the
quick perceiver is often mistaken for a creative genius, and
keenness confused with originality. In politics, for instance,
this was the case with such different beings as Peel and
Gambetta; in literature, with Addison and Arnold; in art,
with Kneller and Lawrence. Disraeli’s ideas were at once
his creations and companions, and he moved in their inner
circle with a sort of extravagant intensity. They were no
shadows. He was convinced of their substance almost to
fatalism, and his immense will-power forced and projected them
into movement. In his extreme youth, before his character
had matured, these ideas flickered as fantasies. The restlessness
of a volition felt, but not yet freed or directed, caused
some masquerade of guise, and a perpetual strain on the
intuition that sought to forestall experience. Realisation alone,
with power and experience, brought repose. But at all periods
an idea that had once seized him tinged his whole being.
Its reality haunted him till he had given it place and shape.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
An inward and ideal energy possessed him. Ideas were for
him far more tangible, even far more sociable, than the outward
and fleeting phantasms around him, as is evidenced in
his fiction by his constant habit of transferring environment
and transplanting personalities to accentuate their ideal
essence. Thus, in <cite>Venetia</cite>, the soul of Lady Byron animates
the form of Shelley’s wife, while the very date is put back
some thirty years, that Shelley himself might be enabled to
have braved in action what he mused in poetry. So, again,
in <cite>Contarini</cite>, the hero’s development blends something of his
own with something of his father’s character; while Baron
Fleming is his grandfather reincarnated as a noble.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> About<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the ironies of these, the arabesques of his playful fancy flickered.
For him they were mostly the pretexts of things, but
ideas were the causes, and he loved to contrast “the pretext
with the cause;” but even here romance blent with irony,
and invested the seemingly trivial with wonder. Some, too,
of his ideas hovered, as it were, over the present scene, in a
flight bound other-whither and beyond. In a word, Disraeli
was an artist, conscious and confident of an over-mastering
call. As he has written in a striking passage from the work
of his youth, <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite>: “I never labour to delude
myself; and never gloss over my own faults. I exaggerate
them; for I can afford to face truth, because I feel capable
of improvement.... I am never satisfied.... The very
exercise of power teaches me that it may be wielded for a
greater purpose.... No one could be influenced by a
greater desire of knowledge, a greater passion for the beautiful,
or a deeper regard for his fellow-creatures.... I want
no false fame. It would be no delight to me to be considered
a prophet, were I conscious of being an impostor.
I ever wish to be undeceived; but if I possess the organisation
of a poet, no one can prevent me from exercising my
faculty, any more than he can rob the courser of his fleetness,
or the nightingale of her song.”</p>

<p>The “ill-regulated will,” “the undercurrent of feelings he
was then unable to express,” portrayed in <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, developed
into the higher and more elevating purposes of which
his transforming imagination was all along capable. That
very book contained the germs of what its composition revealed
to his own mind—that out of a young adventurer with
purpose and genius, the school of life forms a strong character
and a great man. In <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite> the irresistible power
of predisposition, the hollowness of a nurture which ignores
it and substitutes “words” for “ideas,” the interactions of
imagination and experience, the fatuity of contradicting or
overstraining Nature, are pursued; nor, as regards this novel,
should it be forgotten that in some portions of its analysis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
there are traces in allusive undertone to the fatalities of the
great and stricken Dean of St. Patrick’s.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>In Disraeli’s case, as so often before him, “the dreaming
part of mankind” has “prevailed over the waking.” His
flouted dreams came true. They still hold sway. To give
effectual substance to these higher and abiding dreams, those
other dreams of ascendency, through which alone his will
could realise his ideas, were also verified. “It is the will”—he
speaks by the lips of the young “Alroy”—“that is father
to the deed, and he who broods over some long idea, however
wild, will find his dream was but the prophecy of coming fate.”
“All is ordained,” he had said as a stripling, “yet man is master
of his own actions.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Disraeli’s career was itself a romance—a
romance of the will that defies circumstance, and moulds
the soil where ideas are to flourish. An inward, personal
energy is the parent of faith, and faith in oneself is the sole
security for the issue of faith among others. He lived to
triumph, but not in order to triumph; and he remains a
standing protest against those who believe in cliques and disbelieve
in personal influence. The former are only compact
in appearance; they are unsympathetic associations, welded
together by interest alone. Joint-stock enterprise is not
fellowship, and the test of direction is liability. Nor is it
without significance that “Fortune,” even in the ancient
world a real though blind goddess, has come, in the modern,
to mean little more than cash; so that capital leans away
from labour, plutocracy is cemented, solidarity declines, and
worth too often is resolved by the question, “Worth how
much?”</p>

<p>It is this idea of personality that lies at the very root of
united nationality; for a nation is an idealised individual, no
aggregate of atoms. Still less is it the experimenting room
of doctrinaires or the dumping-ground of the Tapers and
Tadpoles, the Paul Prys of politics, who “whisper nothings
that sound like somethings;” or of those “Marneys,” “Fitz-Aquitaines,”
and “Mowbrays” who deem that the end of an
administration is “two garters to begin with;” or again of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
“the good old gentlemanlike times, when Members of Parliament
had nobody to please, and Ministers of State nothing
to do;” of those who, like “Rigby,” mistake peddling with
constituencies for representing the country; or of those petty
placemen to whom, as he has said, party means the machinery
for receiving “£1200” a year, career the pursuit of it, and
success its attainment.</p>

<p>“... I prefer” (the passage is from <cite>Sybil</cite>) “association
to gregariousness.... It is a community of purpose that
constitutes society ... without that men may be drawn into
contiguity, but they will continue virtually isolated....”
What does this imply but the sympathetic power of personality?
The more individual societies become, the greater
their efficacy. The less individual they are the more they
display the tameness and unfruitfulness that enfeeble a
copy.</p>

<p>“But what is an individual,” exclaimed “Coningsby,”
“against a vast public opinion?”</p>

<p>“Divine,” said the stranger. “God made man in His own
image; but the Public is made by newspapers, Members of
Parliament, excise officers, Poor Law guardians. Would
Philip have succeeded, if Epaminondas had not been slain?
And if Philip had not succeeded? Would Prussia have
existed, had Frederick not been born? And if Frederick
had not been born? What would have been the fate of the
Stuarts, if Prince Henry had not died, and Charles I., as was
intended, had been Archbishop of Canterbury?”</p>

<p>This was written in 1844. Since then, would Germany
have been united if Bismarck had not been born? And if
Bismarck had not been born? In 1865 a powerful party,
promising success, reinforced by commanding talent, and concerting
an intelligible plan with immense vigour, began to
demand the disintegration of Great Britain. And if Disraeli
had not been born?——</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Nothing is more striking in modern parliamentary life
than the growing neglect of the past. Great issues are mooted
by men ignorant of, or ignoring, their historical origin. Young
members discuss weighty problems with no study save that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
omniscience. The ancestry of events is disregarded. Development
is relegated to musty students and mouldy volumes.
The fact that statesmanship is able to look forward because
it has already looked back, is flouted or forgotten. Public
interest is gradually being withdrawn from debate, just because
it is getting out of touch with the organic changes of national
life. The genius which transfigures facts with imagination has
been replaced by the opportunism which invests emptiness
with solemnity; and this, in a country where national growth
depends on continuous tradition.</p>

<p>The utterances of Disraeli from the early ’twenties to the
latest ’seventies display a wonderful harmony of coherence
in progress. They form one long suite of variations on
the central <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">motif</i> of persistent and consistent ideas. To
understand them aright one must view them successively, both
in his books and his speeches, which illustrate each other;
nor in so doing should the contexts of personal development,
events private as well as public, be lost from sight.</p>

<p>This I have endeavoured to accomplish in the following
chapters. I have classified their themes in groups broad enough
to admit of kindred topics. After a fresh portrait of Disraeli’s
personality, I treat first of his constitutional ideas, because
these are at the root of his political standpoint; they underlie,
too, his conception of the State. Then follows his attitude
towards Labour and the causes it involved. Next come his
distinctive views on Church and Christianity; his views,
equally distinctive, on Monarchy occupy a separate chapter.
Colonies, Empire, and Foreign Policy are then grouped
together; and it may excite surprise to mark the earliness
and the correctness of his prophecies. Under this head I
also consider his thoughts on India. America and Ireland
succeed; and here again his justified originality is most remarkable.
Perhaps the light chapters on <em>Society</em>, <em>Literature</em>,
<em>Wit</em>, <em>Humour</em>, and <em>Romance</em>, with the closing study of <em>Career</em>,
may be considered not the least suggestive. I have not drawn
on Mr. Meynell’s delightful “Disraeliana” (the pleasure of
reading which I purposely postponed), because I wished this
portraiture of the man and his mind to be wholly original.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">“A</span> great mind that thinks and feels is never inconsistent
and never insincere.... Insincerity is the
vice of a fool, and inconsistency the blunder of a
knave.... Let us not forget an influence too much
underrated in this age of bustling mediocrity—the influence of
individual character. Great spirits may yet arise to guide the
groaning helm through the world of troubled waters—spirits
whose proud destiny it may still be at the same time to maintain
the glory of the Empire and to secure the happiness of
the people.”</p>

<p>So wrote “Disraeli the Younger” during the perplexed
crisis of 1833 in his rare pamphlet, <cite>What is he?</cite><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> which
embodies his own large attitude. The sentence is characteristic
and prophetic. Its last words were repeated more than
forty years afterwards in the message of farewell to his constituents,
when he quitted the lively scene of his triumphs for
that grave assemblage, of which he once said that its aptitudes
were best rehearsed among the tombstones.</p>

<p>In my last three chapters I shall touch on some unique
phases of his boyhood, and outline several of his relations to
his home, to society, to literature, to character, and to career.
But here I shall attempt a less detailed account of his individuality
and of the main ideas which flowed from it.</p>

<p>And first let me venture on two glimpses—one of his
youth, the other of his age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
It is not difficult to collect from many scattered presentments
some likeness of</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Imagine, then, a romantic figure, a Southern shape in a
Northern setting, a kind of Mediterranean Byron; for the
stock of the Disraelis hailed from the <em>Sephardim</em>—Semites
who had never quitted the midland coasts, and were powerful
in Spain before the Goths. The form is lithe and slender,
with an air of repressed alertness. The stature, above middle
height. The head, long and compact; its curls, fantastic.
The oval face, pale rather than pallid, with dark almond eyes
of unusual depth, size, and lustre under a veil of drooping
lashes. The chin, pointed with decision. The expression
holds one, by turns keen and pensive; about it hovers a
strange sense of inner watchfulness and ambushed irony, half
mocking in defiance, half eager with conscious power. A
languid reserve marks his bearing; it conceals a smouldering
vehemence; its observant silence prepares amazement directly
interest excites intercourse. Then indeed the scimitar, as it
were, flashes forth unsheathed, and dazzles by its breathless
fence of words with ideas. This ardour is not always pleasant;
it breathes of storm; it speaks out elemental passions and
grates against the smooth edges of civilisation. In the
London medley he, like his friend Bulwer, studies a purposed
posture. Dandyism and listlessness mask unsleeping energy.
But at Bradenham, his constant retreat, the “Hurstley” of
his last novel, all is natural and unconstrained. Here at
least he is free. Here he “drives the quill” with his famous
father, reads and rides, meditates and is mirthful. Here, with
that gifted sister “Sa”—“Sa,” a name soon afterwards doubly
endeared to him through Lord Lyndhurst’s daughter; “Sa,”
who, while others doubt or twit, ever believes in and heartens
him—he dreams, improvises, discourses. The rest may treat
him as a moonstruck Bombastes,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> but his lofty visions are real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
to the gentle insight of affection. In the language of Shakespeare’s
fine <span class="locked">colloquy:—</span></p>

<p>Already, like one of those his biting pen had satirised, he
too, it must be owned, teems with “confidence in the nation—and
himself.” There was a daredevilry about him, and in
those days a romantic melancholy, akin to that of the Spanish
artist Goya. Far behind have faded those consuming pangs
of boyish restlessness, when fevered imagination played
vaguely on inexperience. Far behind, those schools of
“words” which never slaked his thirst for ideas, and where he
ran wild as rebel ringleader.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Far away now, those boxing
bouts witnessed by Layard’s mother. Past, that earliest and
unpublished novel of <cite>Aylmer Papillon</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> which Murray praised
but would not print. Past, that fugitive satire of the “New
Dunciad,” which does not deserve to remain waste-paper.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
Past, that abortive journal, which in transforming an old
periodical while adopting its name was to have revolutionised
opinion.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Vanished, too, those first outbursts of unchastened
brilliance under the favouring auspices of the Layards’ fair
kinswoman, Mrs. Austin. And the vista of his two long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
journeys have receded; the alternate spells of Venice, the
Rhine and Rome, and afterwards of Athens, Constantinople,
Jerusalem. Past, also, the strange malady for which his
Eastern travels proved the stranger cure. As he muses, the
ball is at his feet. Yet, when the daydream fades, is he,
perhaps, after all, only Alnaschar of the broken glass, bemoaning
vain reveries amid the ruined litter of his overturned
basket in the jeering market-place? The seed-time of reflection
is over: he pants for action. No more for him the
beaten tracks. Hitherto he had fed on books and dreams.
The former had led him to a pondered plan, with Bolingbroke
for clue and Pitt as example. The latter fired his ambition—his
presumption—to realise them by restoring vanished
life to a now mouldering party—by suiting old forms to new
phases and heading them.</p>

<p>Next morning the secluded scholar, so friendly a contrast
with his daring son, is bound for Oxford to receive his long
delayed honours. This very day that son’s earliest election-procession
starts from the doorway of the tranquil manor
house.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Already the budding genius has descried the dim
future of his country, which he has proclaimed must be

<p>What matter now the debts, the duns, the embarrassments
for which he blushes?<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> What matter the heartless allurements
of siren fashion? His course is clear before him. He
must win. He “has begun several times many things, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
has often succeeded at last.” As for the taunt of “adventurer,”
what are all original spirits that “burst their birth’s invidious
bar” but adventurers? Such were Chatham,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and Burke, and
Canning, and Peel himself. But when the “adventurer” is
one by temperament as well as occasion, how miraculous
becomes his progress! “Adventures are to the adventurous.”</p>

<p>Many of us remember Disraeli in his age as he sauntered
dreamily and slowly with the late Lord Rowton, and none
who ever heard one of his last orations in the House of Lords
can forget how, even when he was in pain, he sprang from
his seat with the quick step of youth. The physical charm
had disappeared. Few who gazed on that drawn countenance
could have discerned in it the poetry and enthusiasm of his
prime; only the unworn eyes preserved their piercing fires,
and the sunken jaw was still masterful. A long discipline of
iron self-control, much disillusion, growing disappointments
with crowning triumphs, and latterly a great desolation, had
subdued the fiercer force and the elastic buoyancy of his hey-day.
Yet the intellectual charm, and the spell of mind and
spirit had deepened their outward traces. Fastidious discernment,
dispassionate will, penetrating insight, courage,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
patience, a certain winning gentleness underneath the scorn
of shams, stamp every lineament. Below habitual <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">insouciance</i>,
intensity, bigness of soul and purpose are prominent. The
arch of the noble brow retains its height and curve. Surrounded
though he be by friends and flatterers, he looks lonelier
than of old. “I do not feel solitude,” he said, “it gives one
repose.” Interested in every movement, and even in every trifle
that engages thought, his gaze appears more turned within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
We know from Lady John Manners,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and from other
sources, how he loved flowers, and forestry, and study during
the dinner-hour, more than all the social glitter; how he
communed with the unseen; how far-reaching were his
sympathies; what interest and curiosity he displayed in
every form of career and purpose; how often to all the
splendour which he had conquered he preferred converse with
the weak, the lowly, the suffering; how his wise counsel and
inexhaustible resource were sought and coveted by cottagers,
by the toilers whose cause he made his own, by princes;
how delicately considerate he was in his appointments, and
for all in contact with him, how he would sacrifice a keen
personal wish rather than disturb a pleasure or abridge a
holiday; and yet how his playfulness of fancy mixed in pithy
ironies with his very considerateness. A familiar instance—that
of the attached servant who was to enjoy “the pleasures
of memory”—occurred as he lay dying from the illness long
and bravely concealed even from his intimates. He was truly
unselfish, and he was never known to blame a subordinate.
If things went wrong, he took the whole burden on his own
shoulders. He exerted infinite pains to understand the conditions
of and the organisations affecting labour.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> The Buckinghamshire
peasants still cherish his memory; and it may
be said with truth that the deepest affections of this extraordinary
man, whom vapid worldlings sneered at as a callous
cynic, were reserved for his country, his county, his home, and
his friends, for effort and for distress. Many a young aspirant
to fame, moreover, in literature or public life, has owed
much to his generous encouragement. He liked to dwell on
the vicissitudes of things,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and his own motto, “Forti nihil
difficile,” represents his conviction. In private, when he was
not entertaining, his habits were of the simplest. In two
things only he was profuse; books and light. He loved to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
see every room of Hughenden illuminated with candles. He
was utterly careless of money. It is related, that when he
accepted the Chancellorship of the Exchequer, he sent for the
celebrated Mr. Padwick, and asked for a necessary advance.
“On what security?” inquired the sporting speculator.
“That of my name and my career,” was the answer. And
the money was at once forthcoming, and punctually repaid.
As is well known, he would often make his greatest efforts
half dinnerless; and his delight was, after the strain and the
plaudits had ceased, to betake himself in the dim hours of
dawn to the supper which his devoted wife, who spared him
every detail of management, had prepared, and there to
recount to her the excitements of the debate. The pair
would certainly have endorsed those verses of Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu, of which Byron was so <span class="locked">fond—</span></p>

<p>His public and touching tribute to Mrs. Disraeli deserves
repetition here; nor will the reader forget, among many
hackneyed stories, that stern rebuke to the triflers overheard
discussing the reasons for his marriage—“Because of a feeling
to which such as you are strangers—gratitude.”</p>

<p>It was at Edinburgh, in 1867, when his old ally, Baillie
Cochrane (Lord Lamington), toasted Mrs. Disraeli as her
illustrious husband’s helper and his own dear friend for many
years before Disraeli met her.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Disraeli opened with the
characteristic remark that their mutual intimate “certainly
had every opportunity of studying the subject to which he
has drawn attention.” And he went on to say, “I do owe to
that lady all I think that I have ever accomplished, because she
has supported me with her counsel, and consoled me by the
sweetness of her mind and disposition.” Six years after his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
marriage, he had dedicated the three volumes of his <cite>Sybil</cite>,
“To one whose noble spirit and gentle nature ever prompt
her to sympathise with the suffering; to one whose sweet
voice has often encouraged, and whose taste and judgment
have ever guided their pages; the most severe of critics, but—a
perfect wife.”</p>

<p>Several of his nice things were said in Scotland, and one
of the nicest was his compliment when he was installed
Rector of Glasgow University. He described his visit to
Abbotsford, whither he had repaired in his extreme youth
with an enthusiastic letter from John Murray the First, his
father’s old friend, to Sir Walter Scott, that father’s old
acquaintance. “He showed me,” he said of the laird, “his
demesne, and he treated me, not as if I was an obscure youth,
but as if I were already Lord Rector of Glasgow University.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Disraeli’s marriage was the happiest turning-point in his
career; and that which had begun partly in interest, soon
developed into the warmest, the most entire and the most
mutual affection. Mrs. Disraeli, at a great country house,
always used to commence conversation by the query, “Do
you like my Dizzy? Because, if you don’t——” From
another, on a visit most advantageous to him, Disraeli
departed, despite pressing remonstrance, on the plea that the
“air” disagreed with Mrs. Disraeli—because she had complained
of their host’s rudeness. It will one day be found
that to this gifted and selfless woman, English history owed
much at several serious conjunctures. I cannot resist relating
a good story in another vein. Shortly after Disraeli’s marriage,
a guest at Grosvenor Gate, pointing to a portrait of the late
Mr. Wyndham Lewis, Mrs. Disraeli’s first husband and with
Disraeli member for Maidstone, asked him whom it represented.
“Our former colleague,” was the rejoinder. At a
much later date Mr. Frith was painting a group in which
Disraeli figured. As her husband was going, Mrs. Disraeli
whispered to the artist, “Remember one thing, if you don’t
mind, his pallor is his beauty.” She was afraid that his
complexion would be coloured. To the last she would say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
as she did during his interrupted speech at Aylesbury in
1847:—“<em>He</em> mind them! Not a bit of it. He’s a match
for them all.” Sir Horace Rumbold has just told us how, at
the scene of Disraeli’s investiture as Earl, a sob was heard
from the crowd. It was the grief of an old and faithful servant
sighing, “Ah! If only <em>she</em> had lived to see him now!”</p>

<p>Like childless men in general, he was devoted to children.
More than one still living remembers his happy words of
playful intimacy. To women from the days of his pet
Sheridans to those of the present Lady Currie, he appealed
with magnetism throughout his career, and there are few
more romantic episodes than his meetings, after hesitation,
with the elderly Mrs. Bridges Williams at the fountain in the
Exhibition of 1862, the existing correspondence which ensued,
and the thumping legacy which crowned it. One who has
read that correspondence has assured me that its gentle
chivalry is most striking. In the midst of engrossing occupation
he never ceased to cheer the old lady with gossip of
his doings, and even to argue with her, as on an affair of state,
regarding the advisability of Struve’s seltzer water as a remedy.</p>

<p>Of Queen Victoria’s affection for him I will only say that
it was because he treated her as a woman. She grew to lean
on his wisdom and his judgment. On more than one occasion
he acted as mediator in her family. He was sincerely
attached to her. His witticism, when asked for a reason of
her favour, will bear repetition: “I never argue, I never contradict,
but I sometimes forget.”</p>

<p>His influence over the late Queen was more remarkable
even than has hitherto been disclosed. And in this regard I
am able to state that, while out of office, he negotiated with
extreme tact, under delicate circumstances, the peerage conferred
on a most amiable prince, now no more; and further,
that at each stage of all its bearings Queen Victoria consulted
and deferred to his counsel, kindness, and resource. I may
add that he also devised a means of providing the same
lamented prince with an absorbing occupation.</p>

<p>He was a firm friend; loyalty he always extolled as a
sovereign virtue. Not many have the faculty for friendship
in old age as Lord Beaconsfield had it. His passion for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
mastery, his addiction to mystery were rivalled by his immense
faithfulness. If he was always “the man of destiny,” he was
also ever “faithful unto death.” And his real friendships were
warm as well as constant. While he was at Glasgow to be
inaugurated Lord Rector of its University, he heard good
tidings of an old associate. “Mrs. Disraeli and I,” he wrote,
“were over-joyed, and we danced a Highland fling in our
nightgowns.” The picture raises a smile,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> but it also strikes
an unexpected chord.</p>

<p>Of music and of art in general he was a devotee, as many
passages in his novels attest. He had his own theories of
their influence on composition and on literature. Murillo
was his favourite painter, Mozart his favourite composer.
He ever deplored the insensibility of the Government to the
duty of elevating taste for the beautiful. When the Blacas
collection of gems was in the market at the price of £70,000,
the Administration of the day at first refused to entertain the
purchase, but Disraeli persuaded them by offering to find the
money himself, if they persisted. In this case, as in so many
others (notably that of the Suez Canal shares), imagination
forwarded the public interest; for this collection is now worth
some threefold of what was expended. When a great work by
Raphael was offered to the Government, and Disraeli’s colleagues
were in doubt, Disraeli sent for the leading dealer, in
whose hands the commission had been placed, inspected the
picture himself, discoursed charmingly and critically of its
merits, with the result that it is now in the National Gallery.
Since even trifles about the eminent possess interest, I may
add the following story of his old age. He was showing
a distinguished visitor (still living) his family portraits at
Hughenden. He paused before a pastel of a lovely child
wafted by seraphs through the skies. “That,” he exclaimed,
“is a pet picture; observe how exquisitely the draperies of
the angels are arranged. <em>The baby’s me!</em>” His fondness for
beautiful form extended to his own handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
In matters of courtesy he was old-fashioned and punctilious.
To the last he resented that grotesque disfigurement which
was beginning to make manners ugly before he died. Even
at an earlier date, “Manners are easy,” said “Coningsby,”
“and life is hard.” “And I wish to see things exactly the
reverse,” said “Lord Henry,” “the modes of subsistence less
difficult, the conduct of life more ceremonious.”</p>

<p>In his fiction it was often objected that he over-depicted
great splendour and supreme beauty; that it was thronged
with “daughters” and mansions “of the gods.” But, if he
erred in these respects, it was from familiarity and not from
ostentation, as Lady John Manners has pointed out at
some length. “It must be recollected,” she wrote, thinking of
<cite>Lothair</cite>, “that many of those who most appreciated him, and
whose friendship he warmly reciprocated, are surrounded in
daily life by a certain amount of state which employs their
dependants.” So, too, with regard to the peaceful and
prosperous marriages of those homes of forty years ago on
which he delighted to dwell. He loved the gentle Buckinghamshire
landscape, with its treasures of association in every
cranny, more than all the remembered luxuriance of the South
and glare of the East. And it should also be remembered that
his works abound in sympathetic descriptions of all kinds and
conditions of men, including the strangest and humblest.
They were taken from personal observation, and he himself
would penetrate the queerest haunts to gain the most curious
insight. The common and the uncommon people fascinated
him, for in them he found ideas; the middling charmed him
less. He delighted to invest the seemingly commonplace with
significance, and also to strip the pretentiously important of its
wonder. Not even Dickens, as I shall hint hereafter, knew or
loved his London better. I shall also, in the proper place,
touch on the exotic element in his style and accent. Mr.
John Morley has aptly compared it to Goethe’s dictum about
St. Peter’s, that, though it is <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">baroque</i>; it is always the expression
of something great and not merely grandiose. His big words
are never for little things. Undoubtedly some of his earliest
works are deficient in taste; and there is a certain fierce
hardness in their abrupt violence. Mrs. Austin advised him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
in omissions from the original manuscript of <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>; it
was to women that he owed his training in these directions.
His knowledge was vast and profound, and he exercised the
habit of pursuing long trains of thought in reflection. He
seldom worked at night, preferring that season for brooding
over his ideas. But at all times, contrary to the superficial
opinion, he worked long and hard, sometimes over ten hours
a day. His gift of divination never dimmed his passion for
study, until old age and ill-health warned him that it must
pause. He never ceased to deplore the want of “that boundless
leisure which we literary men need.” To the last, as Lord
Iddesleigh has pointed out, he studied the Bible in the earliest
hours. In church attendance he was what Mr. Gladstone used
to call a “oncer.” He was a regular communicant.</p>

<p>By success he was never inflated, by reversals never depressed,
although by nature elastic.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> It was not until 1874
that his power became wholly unfettered, and then foreign
crisis claimed the attention that he longed to bestow on
social improvements and Colonial Confederation. His three
previous spans of office had been equally brief. For some
twenty years he headed, at intervals, a despairing Opposition,
whose mistrustful murmurs had to be stilled, whose
doubts had to be dispelled, and the immense difficulties of
whose management he has graphically portrayed in a notable
passage from his <cite>Life of Lord George Bentinck</cite>. To the
printed diatribes which assailed him he was indifferent.
In parliamentary generalship, demanding an infinite insight
and management, an instant recognition of movements in the
mass, and “creation of opportunity,” he was unsurpassed even
by Peel, who played on Parliament “as on an old fiddle.” To
his urgent control even so early as 1854, and when out of office,
the correspondence with Spencer Walpole affords a striking
insight. “My dear Walpole,” he writes on November 29 of
that year, “remember to write to the Queen if anything of
interest happens to-night. Tell somebody, Harry Lennox or
another, to send me a bulletin by this messenger of what is
taking place, but not later than ten o’clock, as I shall retire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
early, that being my only chance. Be positive that the
financial statement will be made on Friday.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>What he really valued in power was its faculty of influence.
Otherwise it was bitter-sweet. He once told a high aspirant
for high office, that as for its <em>pleasures</em>, they lay chiefly in contrasting
the knowledge it afforded of what was really being
done with the ridiculous chatter about affairs in the circles that
one frequented.</p>

<p>His wit, his brightness of humour, and lightness of touch,
long prevented many of his contemporaries from taking him
seriously. Literary statesmen are often belittled by their
generation; imaginative statesmen, always. They have
usually to await a career after death. The stereotyped
character imposed on him till his pluck and power appealed
to the nation at large was largely due to the old Whigs
(“oligarchy is ever hostile to genius”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>), who for years refused
to regard him with anything but amusement, yet whose
drawing-rooms had been the readiest to applaud those
sparkling sallies of 1845 and 1846 that demolished the premier
whom they too wished to destroy; that coterie so long
trained to make popular causes preserve their exclusive power,
and of whom he wrote in 1833, “A Tory, a Radical, I understand;
a Whig, a democratic aristocrat, I cannot comprehend.”
It was not due to the Peelites, who frankly hated him as an
open foe. Even the Liberals (many of whom he counted as
personal friends), when he warned them of the underground
rumblings, ominous of social earthquake in Ireland, shrugged
their shoulders; and when he was reported, glass in eye, to
have answered a duchess inquisitive about the exact date of
the dissolution with “You darling,” they split their sides, and
guffawed, “There he is again!” They agreed with his old
family acquaintance, Bernal Osborne (if it was he), to whom
the heartlessness was attributed of saying, when Lord Beaconsfield
was stricken with his lingering illness, “Overdoing it,
as usual.”</p>

<p>And yet how interesting it is to find Disraeli in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Grant-Duff diaries discoursing eagerly in the faint dawn on
Westminster Bridge of Lord John Russell. Perhaps Disraeli’s
greatest admirer among opponents was Cobden, and that
admiration was warmly returned. Both of them had one
great virtue in common, and a rare one, especially in public
life—gratitude; and both could afford to be generous. Read
the letter now first disclosed by Mr. John Morley, whose
literary appreciation of Disraeli is manifest, in which Disraeli
sought to win Gladstone with “deign to be magnanimous.”</p>

<p>Disraeli’s own magnanimity—frankly owned by Mr. Gladstone—was
conspicuous though it is unfamiliar. During the
decade of the ’fifties, on at least four occasions<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> he offered to
sacrifice his personal position to Graham, Palmerston, and
Gladstone successively for the interests of his country and
his party. In 1868 and 1869 he indignantly defended the last
against the carping “tail” of his supporters, rebuking alike the
“frothy spouters of sedition,” and those who preferred remembrance
of “accidental errors” to gratitude for “splendid gifts
and signal services.” His unstinted praise of worthy foes, his
conduct even towards the ostracised Dr. Kenealy, are constant
proofs of a leading <em>trait</em>. He always forebore to strike an opponent
to please the whim or the passion of the popular breeze.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">À propos</i> of Mr. Gladstone, who himself paid a tribute to
the absence of rancour in his rival, I may be permitted to
recall an anecdote told me by the late Sir John Millais.
When Disraeli stood (though then suffering, he refused to
<em>sit</em>) for his last portrait, his “dear Apelles” noticed his gaze
riveted on an engraving of the artist’s fine portrait of the
great premier. “Would you care to have it?” he inquired.
“I was rather shy of offering it to you.” “I should be
delighted to have it,” was the reply. “Don’t imagine that
I have ever disliked Mr. Gladstone; on the contrary, my only
difficulty with him has been <em>that I could never understand him</em>.”
And Carlyle himself thawed when Disraeli, whom he had so
long hysterically abused, but many of whose ideas, as I shall
prove, he shared, offered him public recognition in a letter
which gave as a reason for uninheritable honours, “I have
remembered that you too, like myself, are childless.” But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Carlyle, who had aspersed him, never denied that he looked
facts in the face without mistaking phantoms for them. Even
from the first he owned length of view. In his old age a certain
far-awayness of expression was very noticeable.</p>

<p>I have mentioned Mr. Gladstone. It was well for England
that two great attitudes towards great questions should have
been thrown into sharp relief for nearly a score of years by
the duel between two great personalities; and it was also well
for Disraeli that “England does not love coalitions.” We
know from Mr. Gladstone’s own lips that much in his rival
had won his respect, while from Mr. Morley we glean that
Mr. Gladstone even struggled with a sort of subacid liking for
one whom he too could “never comprehend.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The letters of
both after Lady Beaconsfield’s death are refreshing instances
of how sworn enemies of the arena may grasp hands under
the softening solemnity of bereavement, and for a moment
forget the hard words which, under irritation, they certainly
used of each other.</p>

<p>Disraeli was older than Gladstone, and had been early
acquainted with him. In the ’thirties he sat next to “young
Gladstone” at the Academy dinner, and regretted that he
had been relegated from “the wits,” with whom he had been
ranged in the year previous, to “the politicians.” In the
’forties Disraeli made one of his few mistakes in prognostic,
when he wrote to his sister, “I doubt if he has an ‘avenir’;”
but the significance of Gladstone’s resignation at this juncture
on “Maynooth,” and the peculiar circumstances of the Peelites
must be borne in mind. Disraeli could scarcely then divine
the surprises of oscillation in store.</p>

<p>Except in vigour of undaunted character, and in a sort of
inward loneliness, their qualities were opposed. The intensity
of the one was austere, imperious, imposing, and didactic; of
the other, buoyant, lively, and poignant. Frequently the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
flippancy of certain leaders provoked his gravity; more frequently
the solemnity of others upset his own. Gladstone
moved by violent reaction and hasty rebound; Disraeli, by a
spring of step, it is true, but of a step measured, wary, and
equal. Disraeli stamped himself on his age; it was often the
“Time-Spirit” that impressed itself on Mr. Gladstone, a list of
whose changeful “convictions”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> from 1836 to 1896 might fill
a small volume. Again, Disraeli’s utterance left a stronger
sense of reserve power, of something serious behind the veil.
Mr. Gladstone’s phases, always sincere, in the main struck more
the conscience of certain sections; Disraeli’s ideas, the national
feelings. Mr. Gladstone’s subtleties were those of a theologian;
they did not quicken the lay mind. Disraeli’s were the subtleties
of an artist; they put things in new perspectives. It
might be said that by nature and unconscious bent, the one
hid simplicity under the form of subtlety, while with the
other the process was the converse. In oratory, Mr. Gladstone
convinced by height and redundance of enthusiasm, by
depth of feeling and weight or wealth of words and gestures;
Disraeli, more by grasp, incisiveness, and point; his imagination
played all round many sides of his subject. Gladstone’s
eloquence resembled the storminess and the mist of the North
Sea; Disraeli’s, the strange lights and shadows, the subtle and
tideless lustre of the Mediterranean. As Mr. Gladstone warmed
to his theme, he increased in eloquence; his perorations are
always great. It was in peroration that Disraeli sometimes
failed, except in his after-dinner speeches, which never missed
fire from start to finish.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone was saturated, Disraeli tinctured, with the
classics. Mr. Gladstone was essentially the scholar, and he was
Homeric, while Disraeli was Horatian and Tacitean. His ready
acquaintance with Latin masterpieces was shown when he first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
took the oaths as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and hit off a
most happy quotation on the spur of the moment; nor will it
be forgotten that once, when he was citing a classic in the
House, he added, “Which, for the sake of the successful
capitalists around me, I will now try to translate.”</p>

<p>Again, despite Mr. Gladstone’s immense versatility, there
was always something cloistral about him. He himself confessed
that till he was fifty he did not “know the world.” I
venture to doubt if he ever knew it, and it was just this
academic simplicity that so often led his huge brain-power to
deal with unsubstantial material.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone will not live through his books. He was
far more a writer than an author, though he was always
distinguished in all his undertakings. But he was doctrinaire;
and he was almost devoid of any real sense of humour. On
the appearance of “Nicholas Nickleby” he owned its merit,
but singled out its pathos with the criticism that he was
grieved by the absence from it of the religious sentiment—“No
Church!” In this respect Disraeli and Gladstone were
brought into amusing contrast during the Bulgarian atrocity
campaign. Mr. Gladstone had characterised the Premier’s
attitude as “diabolical.” Disraeli, in a speech, referred to
Mr. Gladstone’s having called him “a devil.” Mr. Gladstone
denied the impeachment, and asked for verse and chapter.
Disraeli rejoined by writing that “the gentlemen who so
kindly assist me in the conduct of public affairs” had used
their best endeavours to ascertain the precise time and place
when the Prince of Darkness had been named, but hitherto
without success.</p>

<p>A famous bookseller, with whom both statesmen frequently
conversed, used to recount that Disraeli once inquired, as was
his wont, what of new interest was forthcoming. He mentioned
one of Mr. Gladstone’s Vatican pamphlets. “No,”
was the answer; “please not that. Mr. Gladstone is a powerful
writer, but nothing that he writes is literature.”</p>

<p>In the House of Commons Disraeli had schooled himself
from the first to conceal the emotions of a nature naturally
quick and sensitive. He early lit on two mechanical devices
for this purpose: the one was to stroke his knees regularly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
with his hand, the other to scan the clock. When he was
much angered it was only by a change of colour that his
agitation was ever betrayed. It must be confessed that he
loved to “draw” Mr. Gladstone, and those who remember
how, when Disraeli sat down and relapsed into impassivity,
Mr. Gladstone jumped up with a look of rage and a voice of
thunder, will admit that both performances were perfect. But
the audience expected the scene which became habitual, and
even supreme actors are influenced by the expectation of
their audience. Neither Gladstone nor Disraeli ever stooped
to ill-nature. Great men are not petty. But the moral
indignation of the one, and the intellectual indignation of the
other, which sometimes exchanged places, lent the semblance
of pique or of quarrel. Disraeli’s dislike of spleen is well
displayed by what he once said of Abraham Hayward, the
caustic reviewer: “If that man were to be run over in the
streets, you would see his venom swimming in the gutters.”</p>

<p>In debate, Disraeli’s characteristics were a quick readiness
and an inexhaustible power of diverting discussion to new
channels and of defeating expectation. The occasion when,
in reply to Mr. Whalley concerning the Jesuits, he answered
that one of their pet devices was to send over Jesuits in
disguise to decry the Jesuits, will recur to the memory. His
power of literary illustration needs no comment. Two brilliant
instances are that of the boots of the Lion embracing the
chambermaid of the Boar in connection with the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>
and <cite>Quarterly Reviews</cite>, and that charming one about the
Abyssinian expedition, where he reminded us that the standard
of St. George was flying over the mountains of Rasselas.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> In
retort he was supreme. Two of the best instances are to be
noted in the rejoinder to Peel about “candid friends” and
Canning, and in the pause he made when in a much later
speech he said, “I have never attacked any one” (cries of
“Peel”) “unless I was first assailed.” I shall relate some
others hereafter. His self-imposed impassiveness of demeanour
in the House was that of a sentinel on bivouac; it
became exaggerated by the contrast of his illustrious compeer’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
extreme excitability. Disraeli was very zealous for the
honour of the House in which he passed the greater portion
of his life. On one occasion a young and violent adversary
insinuated that Disraeli had told a lie. Disraeli calmly cleared
himself to the general satisfaction, and his denouncer began
to feel uncomfortable; still more so when he was sent for to
the great man’s private room. What was his surprise when
he was shaken warmly by the hand. “We all make mistakes,”
said Disraeli, “when we are young. But please to remember all
your life that the House of Commons is a house of gentlemen.”</p>

<p>For sheer insight into the march of ideas and reach of
vision there is no comparison between the two. Even in the
’forties Disraeli perceived that the coming choice lay between
absolute democracy and a monarchical democracy. Afterwards—in
the early ’fifties, while monarchy in England was
still far from popular—he laid his plans—as is apparent from
his contributions to his organ, <cite>The Press</cite>, in 1853—to popularise
monarchy and educate democracy before enfranchising
it; and, not till that was accomplished, to re-imperialise Great
Britain. “He has not,” he wrote in 1853 of Lord John
Russell, “comprehended that for the last twenty years the
choice is between the maintenance of those institutions and
habits of thought which preserve monarchy, and that gradual
change into absolute democracy to which Tocqueville somewhere
rashly considered all the tendencies of our age impel
the destinies of Europe.... The Whigs should have been
conservative of the reformed constitution, and have developed
it....”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> While Gladstone was refining a rather tortuous
conscience into making the forlorn Peelites alternate between
the Conservatives and the Whigs, Disraeli was reconstructing
and developing a national party. While Gladstone and
Sidney Herbert, in righteous indignation at Peel’s memory,
were enraged at the delinquency of not struggling for absolute
protection when the Derby Ministry assumed office, Disraeli
showed that the <em>principle</em> of his struggle (continued as
regarded the sugar repeal) had been land and labour. He
must now benefit these by alleviations, rather than, as a
responsible Minister, attempt an upheaval of what the nation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
had finally endorsed, and set private opinion as to particular
measures at variance with the possibility of government at
all. Had he done so he would have been doing what Fox
himself had not attempted with regard to Catholic emancipation,
what Lord John Russell had not thought of in 1847,
what no responsible Minister could have compassed, and
what, Lord John Russell added, the Whigs could not do in
1835. And yet, out of sheer honest hatred, he was vilified
by those “high and stubborn spirits who, with the severity
peculiar to those censors who cannot aspire to be consuls,
refuse to acknowledge that there could be any virtue of
necessity, ... and could not enlarge their comprehension
of the requisites of a statesman beyond quotations from
‘Hansard.’ There were surely some juster thinkers in the
House of Commons who must have trembled at the doctrine
that men in office are rigidly to carry out the opinions they
proposed in opposition.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> That, he points out, is the
function of opposition, and the duty of supporting opinions
which a nation has cancelled never arises unless those
opinions have sent you to office. As he puts it, “Themis
is the goddess of opposition, but Nemesis sits in Downing
Street.” In the overthrow of Peel lay a very different moral,
and by that overthrow he wished to lay bare the choice
between “Liberal opinions” and “popular principles,” between
Peel’s sudden adoption of the “physical enjoyment” theory
of regeneration and his own. By that destruction he eventually
ended the Whigs and Peelites alike, and set before the
country the true choice that awaited it, instead of the perplexity
of parties<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> which, joined to detestation of himself,
caused the coalition of 1853 and prevented the contrast of
the ideas which really divided the minds of men from being
prominent in true proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
As a practical statesman, Disraeli thought more of those
moral elements by which the State can square private duty
with public interest; Gladstone, more of those elements above
and beyond conduct. Gladstone was perhaps more of an
apostle, Disraeli of a seer. Gladstone owned a noble heart
with lofty spiritual standards, and an enormous quality of
moral resentment; but his Church views coloured his life as
much as his religious convictions, while his minute and perplexing
scruples too often changed the forms of his enthusiasms,
led zeal to chime with prejudice, and sometimes sent
him astray altogether into self-deception.</p>

<p>Gladstone was a strange compound of diverse elements—of
Highlander and Lowlander, of Scotland, Liverpool, Oxford,
and Italy. In some respects he might even be termed the
Dante of politics; but in others he was occasionally deemed
its Ignatius Loyala. Disraeli, on the other hand, depended
on his singular force of independence and of native sight and
foresight. Those who admired the early Gladstone as Sir
Galahad never wished him to sit on the seat of Merlin; nay,
Gladstone himself perpetually deemed Disraeli, Machiavelli,
or even Cagliostro. In relation to Disraeli, Gladstone would
have perhaps addressed England with “O foolish Galatians,
who hath bewitched you?” while Disraeli might have retorted
by the witticism of Sarah, Duchess of Marborough, on the
eagerness of James the Second to drag his country to heaven
with him. It was just Disraeli’s originality and length of
view that caused him to be maligned as well as misunderstood,
though by some his conduct towards Peel was not unnaturally
eyed askance. And yet, in Mr. Morley’s “Life,”
Lord John Russell is to be found vindicating his own share in
that transaction,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and Sir James Graham himself admitting
that Peel provoked what he suffered.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> In the eyes of many,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Gladstone was Homer’s “old man of the sea” trying to hold
Proteus, and yet none proved more Protean through enlarging
aspirations than “the old man” himself. Perhaps Gladstone
regarded the world more as the “Pilgrim’s Progress,” Disraeli
more as “Vanity Fair.” Gladstone had more sail,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Disraeli
more ballast. The one floated on waves of agitation, the other
desired a strong government by steadying the people and
attaching them to institutions. Moreover, Gladstone constantly
viewed the State from the standpoint of his particular
Church opinions. Disraeli believed that the principle of
the Revolution had never been perfected by the due development
of popular institutions. He agreed with Pym
that “the best form of government is that which doth dispose
and actuate <em>every</em> part and member of a State to the common
good.”</p>

<p>Disraeli owned, of course, his foibles, though he was too
proud ever to be very vain. As we shall find later on, when
I come to his faults of temperament, his grasp of ideas occasionally
pressed them too literally both on life and letters.
He tended to overstrain his lights and shadows. His imagination
sometimes ran riot in its colours, and throughout tended
to exaggerate the forms of events, though hardly ever their
significance, which he was often the first to divine. He is
said to have cherished some superstitions about lucky days
and unlucky colours, but for these I cannot vouch. I can,
however, for the fact that he was once seen by intimates to
wear a green velvet smoking-coat, though one of the few
occasions on which he troubled the newspapers was to refute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
the slander of having, when young, appeared in green trousers.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
And here I may perhaps be pardoned for inserting a slight
story about Mrs. Disraeli, which comes from the same source
as the last. Dr. Guthrie was once staying at Grosvenor Gate,
and invited his hostess to visit him at Glasgow. “I will,” she
smiled, “if you will promise to wear your kilt in the streets.”
“Perhaps I will,” he replied, with hesitation. “You had better
be careful, Guthrie,” interposed Disraeli, “for that woman, I
assure you, means what she says.”</p>

<p>In taste and in phrase he was naturally extravagant, but
his epigrams were never for the sake of paradox, and were
always the summaries of wisdom and reflection. They were
light, not frivolous; they were imaginative proverbs. There
never was a wittier man, and his wit lent itself to his ironic
humour. He loved effects that struck imagination, but ever
for a crucial purpose. It was said of him by an intimate that
one of his sentences—and in conversation he was sparing—left
more behind than a long talk with others of consummate
talent. As for the scathing sarcasm—his weapon of self-defence
during his earlier stages—at times over-savage and
belying his normal cheeriness—sobriety of judgment is compatible
<span class="locked">with—</span></p>

<p class="in0">often irritated and even offended not only the dull, but the
serious. And yet in life, as in literature, is there more than
one step in the descent from the sublime to the ridiculous?</p>

<p>Like all celebrated wits, he suffered both from the ascription
of his own <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bons mots</i> to others, and from those of others
being fathered upon him. Thus the “without a redeeming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
vice” (about Lord Hatherley) was his, not Westbury’s,
while the “dinner all cold except the ices,” was said not
by him, but by Sir David Dundas. His pithy sentences
were simply one manifestation of his naturally laconic turn of
mind.</p>

<p>He was occasionally over-adroit, especially in his desire to
gain distinguished recruits for his party; and he sometimes,
perhaps, magnified the machinations of secret conspiracies,
although their hidden tyranny was gauged by him with
unerring instinct. His predilection both in art and nature was
for extremes. Full of atmosphere himself, he owned the social
nerves which suffer overmuch from lack of it in others. He
detested bores, those masterpieces of nature’s bad art. One
of them (if I may say so without disrespect to his kindness
and amiability, since departed) has told with artless humour
how at one of the last dinner-parties that Lord Beaconsfield
attended, he engaged him in conversation, but was pained to
notice how ill and absent he seemed. Suddenly, however, on
the arrival of a distinguished guest, a Russian diplomatist,
the great man brightened and grew young again, as if by
miracle!</p>

<p>After his elevation to the peerage,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> when he would often
revisit the “glimpses of the moon,” and watch new members
with rapt interest, on one occasion he listened patiently to a
long speech of ideal dreariness from the lips of one unknown
to him. He inquired, as usual, who the speaker was, and
learned that Mr. —— had no other peculiarity but deafness.
“Poor fellow!” he sighed, “and yet he seems unaware of his
natural advantages. He cannot hear himself speak.”</p>

<p>Of Disraeli’s attitude towards fashionable society, as well
as towards that which really fascinated him, I shall say more
in my eighth chapter; but one incident of his old age must
be presented here. I can vouch for it, since it was told me
by an eye-witness—a political opponent.</p>

<p>It was after “Peace with honour”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>—after he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
“descended from the Teutonic chariot,” after the congress where
he discovered the alternative Russian map of Bulgaria, concealed
by diplomacy, where he earned Bismarck’s undying
praise and admiration. The scene was a magnificent reunion
in an historic mansion. All the fine flower of society was
gathered in a galaxy of splendour and of grandeur. In one
of the saloons a brilliant crowd was awaiting Lord Beaconsfield’s
entry. As the big doors opened, a thrill went through
them. Haughty ladies in the feeling of the moment made
obeisance as if to royalty, while that pale figure with the inscrutable
smile passed along their serried ranks. Unmoved
and immovable, he went straight forward, his eyes fixed on
the future, scarcely conscious of their presence, except for
his recognition of their homage.</p>

<p>Such are some of his leading features. They combine and
reconcile the seeming contradictions of a nature at once calm
and impetuous, deep and light, astute and far-seeing in affairs
of importance; in trifles, careless. These contrasts, united by
genius, pursue the forms of his mind—his ideas. He was, of
course, no monster of consistency, but the ideas that animated
his actions and utterance sprang from a singularly consistent
outlook and a most definite personality. In every case they
were the outcome on the one hand of his race, on the other
of his nationality. The antithesis between nationality and
mere race is most important, and too often ignored. There is
no such thing as a nation of a single strain. The national idea
is the fusion of reconcilable races, the creation of an artificial
and ideal individuality, of a consolidating pattern; the absorption
of discordant races and their replacement by a central
idea which subordinates instinct to society. Later civilisation
means little else, if we reflect, than a gradual process of this
description; and it is not a little curious that the distinctive
greatness of English literature is largely due to the admission
and naturalisation of foreign influences—to England’s free
trade in ideas, to the openness of her literary ports. What
would it have proved had it remained purely insular; if Italy,
France, and Germany had not infused both form and spirit;
above all, if it had not been inspired by the noble rhythm of
the Englished Bible and by the supreme models of Greece and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Rome? Disraeli’s wit, which is to find a due consideration
hereafter, is half eighteenth century in form, half talmudic.
The shape of his ideas was also partly determined by the
time of his birth and by the circumstances of his home.</p>

<p>He was born at the parting of the ways. His early reading,
and, indeed, his cast of mind, were steeped in the style
of the eighteenth century; but the movements of the nineteenth,
the significance of the French Revolution and of
Napoleon, who had made all things new, simmered in him
from the first, and his earliest reflections were how to attune
the democratic idea to the vital institutions of an ancient
empire. As regards his home, he was truly, as he has put it,
“born in a library;” and this circumstance contributed as
much as others to a certain detachment of thought which in
politics afforded him the clue to the character of movements,
and, above all, to the movements of character; in fiction, as
will be apparent from my ninth chapter, it led him to regard
things as they appeared of themselves, and not always as they
seemed to others; while under the play of fancy he transposed
their outward environments to accentuate their essence.
Of his father, himself a most interesting study, I shall have
more to say in my eighth chapter. Here, I only wish to draw
attention to the fact that Isaac Disraeli’s influence on his
son’s ideas was twofold. On the one hand, his views on “predisposition,”
on the use of solitude, on the true meaning of
education, on historical “cause and pretext,” on the hollowness
of “joint-stock felicity,” on the self-recognition of creative
minds before their late acknowledgment by contemporaries,
with others glanced at in my later chapters, were directly
derived by Disraeli from his father. From him, too, he
inherited his fondness for Burke. On the other hand, Disraeli’s
native leanings reacted against many of that peripatetic philosopher’s
opinions. His interpretation of the Bible was, if not
at variance with, at any rate different from his father’s,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and
was, I fancy, shared by his sister. His admiration for
Bolingbroke, as genius and constitutional interpreter, was in
direct opposition, just as that father’s own dispassionate outlook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
remained independent and often the reverse of his own early
associations. Byron, however, entered Disraeli’s mental being
through his father; and of three main influences on his boyhood—the
Bible, Bolingbroke, and Byron (strange conjunction!),
the last was not the least.</p>

<p>Outside politics, the contradictions combined in Disraeli’s
mind are patent throughout his fiction, and they were reconciled
by his leading idea that everything great in the world
springs from individuality alone. Thus, for example, as
regards Destiny, he was both for free will and fatalism—the
individual will was for him the universal fate. If a man, he
has said, is ready to die for an object, he must attain it unless
he has utterly miscalculated his powers. Then again, the
twin sympathies of his mind, both with antique authority and
modern revolution, its bias towards the Chartism of <cite>Sybil</cite>, the
chivalry of her aristocratic deliverer, and the discipline of her
time-honoured creed, towards the noble personality of “Theodora”
in <cite>Lothair</cite> (his finest heroine),<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> and the noble ideals
of “Coningsby”—these are reconciled by the national idea,
the idea that sets earned privilege and reciprocal duties above
and against illimitable and irresponsible “rights.” “Conspiracies
are for aristocrats, not for nations.”</p>

<p>In this regard it is most interesting to observe the influence
of Shelley on Disraeli—a subject which has been treated by
Dr. Richard Garnett in a masterly monograph.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> From many
of his conclusions I dissent, but his facts are most enlightening,
and form an entrancing comment on the character of
“Herbert” in <cite>Venetia</cite>. He shows that probably through
Trelawny, whom he met often at Lady Blessington’s, Disraeli
gleaned many recollections and even thoughts and words,
unpublished till the Shelley Papers were given to the world
some years afterwards; that his description too of the ethereal
poet as “a golden phantom” is probably Trelawny’s own;
that subtle shades of admiring appreciation are to be traced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
throughout; that Disraeli was undoubtedly influenced by
Shelley’s thoughts. The discovery of these in some portions
of the <cite>Revolutionary Epick</cite> (where “Demogorgon” is
introduced) does not seem to me conclusive; nor are the
verbal resemblances singled out for comparison very striking.
I cannot close this branch of my subject without noticing a
fact almost unknown. In 1825, when Disraeli was a stripling,
he published an anonymous pamphlet, which may be found
in the British Museum, on the restrictions enforced by the
Government upon the British working of American mines.
The tract is boldly dedicated “by a sincere admirer”
to Canning,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> as “one who has reformed without bravery or
scandal of former times or persons; asking counsel of both
times; <em>of the ancient times that which is best, of the modern
times, that which is fittest</em>;” and it further contains this remarkable
passage, if we remember its date, about <span class="locked">America—</span></p>

<p>“... The prosperity of England mainly depends upon
its relations with America, and in proportion as the energies
of America are developed and her resources strengthened,
will the power and prosperity of England be confirmed and
increased.”</p>

<p>In the domain of politics Disraeli, as I shall show at length,
divined in the national institutions the chief engine for the
revival of unity and for social regeneration. When he denounced
the Conservatism of the early ’forties as an “organised
hypocrisy,” he did so just because, as it seemed to his eyes, the
hopes once centred on Peel as the restorer of a truly “national”
party were being shattered by his failure, under ordeal, to
govern, to develop the institutions which he was called on
to preserve, by his erection of “registration” into a party
idol, by his policy of polls, by his cold indifference and suspicion
of the youthful regenerators, who confronted the middle
classes with the middle ages. “Whenever,” indignantly urged
Disraeli in 1845, “whenever the young men of England allude
to any great principle of political or parliamentary conduct,
are they to be recommended to go to a railway committee?”
And he found in his once chief’s temperament of discouraging
formality and timorous desire for “fixity of tenure,” for <em>staying</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
power, a reason for the stultification of the House of Lords:
“... It is not Radicalism; it is not the revolutionary spirit of
the nineteenth century which has consigned ‘another place’
to illustrious insignificance; it is ‘Conservatism’ and a Conservative
dictator.”</p>

<p>Disraeli was one born with aristocratic perceptions, yet
with a bent “popular” rather than “democratic” in the strict
sense of those terms. “Democracy” in the concrete he considered
as the unsettlement of compact nationality through
the undue preponderance of a single class; democracy in the
abstract he considered as a lever for ambitious tribunes. But
the welfare of the people was ever his chief concern, and he
knew full well that it is constantly foiled by the side-aims of
those vociferous on its behalf. When he first appeared on
the political horizon, neither of the great historical parties
owned popular sympathies. The Tories dreaded “Radicalism”
because they were blind to the possibilities of its adoption
into the order of the State. Of the Whigs, democratic enthusiasms
were at once the tools and the abhorrence. Disraeli
determined to infuse them into those free yet settled institutions
of which the Tories were the natural but forgetful
guardians. His main purpose from the outset was to implant
the new ideas of freedom on the ancient soil of order; to
engraft them productively without uprooting the native
undergrowth; to harmonise the modern democratic idea
with those English traditions which had always harboured
its older forms. His work was to accommodate federal to
feudal principles; to render democracy in England national
and natural; to popularise leadership; to make democracy
aristocratic in the truest sense of the term; to undo the
closed aristocracy of caste and to revive the open aristocracy
of excellence wherever displayed. My next two chapters
investigate this idea; and it will be found afterwards, when
I discuss his notion of empire and his attitude towards our
colonies, that his ideals of Great Britain’s destiny and responsibility
flow straight from this ruling outlook. The
same consideration applies to the many other problems
which I shall discuss in the light of Disraeli’s relations to
them. Throughout, in one form or another, and in many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
applications, the free play of responsible individuality forms
the keynote. He constantly opposes it alike to the barren
uniformity of republican models, and to the centralising
dictatorship whether of groups or of tyrants. He contrasts
the personal with the mechanical. The State in his eyes
should prove the sympathetic expression of the whole community.
These aspects will find ample exposition hereafter.
In this place I wish only to quote their bold and broad
emphasis in the unfamiliar pamphlet of <cite>What is he?</cite> with
one citation from which I opened this chapter. It will
explain those passages in his <cite>Runnymede Letters</cite> and <cite>The
Spirit of Whiggism</cite>, where he expects and adjures Peel to
head a “national party” and to replace confederacies by
a creed. It will also illustrate that passage in the election
address to High Wycombe during 1832, which preludes his
mission as the renewer of a popular Conservatism. “...
Englishmen, behold the unparalleled empire raised by the
heroic energies of your fathers, rouse yourselves in this hour
of doubt and danger, rid yourselves of all that political jargon
and factious slang of Whig and Tory, two names with one
meaning, used only to delude you, and unite in forming a
great national party....”</p>

<p>“The first object of a statesman,” he says (and he was
then barely twenty-nine years of age), “is a <em>strong Government</em>,
without which there can be no security. Of all countries
in the world, England most requires one, since the prosperity
of no society so much depends upon public confidence as
that of the British nation.”</p>

<p>He then declares that the old principle of exclusion
(common alike to the Whig oligarchs and the debased
Toryism of Eldon) is dead.</p>

<p>“... The moment the Lords passed the Reform Bill
from menace instead of conviction, the aristocratic principle
of government in this country, in my opinion, expired for
ever.” The democratic principle becomes necessary to maintain
a Government at all. “If the Tories,” he continues,
“indeed despair of restoring the aristocratic principle, and
are sincere in their avowal that the State cannot be governed
with the present machinery, it is their duty to coalesce with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the Radicals,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> and permit both political nicknames to merge
into the common, the intelligible, and the dignified title of a
national party.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>He proceeds to prove in a few decisive strokes that the
towns are now the safeguards against any military invasion
of rights, and that a coalition between the then Whigs and
the then Tories is impossible; the only alternative, therefore,
is the inclusion of the democratic principle.</p>

<p>“Without being a system-monger,” he resumes, repeating
the refrain of his previous <cite>Revolutionary Epick</cite>, “I cannot
but perceive that the history of Europe for three hundred
years has been a transition from feudal to federal principles.”
If not their origin, these contending principles have blended
with all the struggles that have occurred.—“The revolt of
the Netherlands impelled, if it did not produce, our revolution
against Charles I. That of the Anglo-American colonies
impelled, if it did not produce, the Revolution in France.”
“This,” he says, “is not a party pamphlet, and appeals
to the passions of no order of the State.” “It is wise,” he
concludes, “to be sanguine in public as well as in private
life; yet the sagacious statesman must view the present portents
with anxiety, if not with terror. It would sometimes
appear that the loss of our colonial empire must be the
necessary consequence of our prolonged domestic discussions.
Hope, however, lingers to the last. In the sedate but vigorous
character of the British nation we may place great confidence.”
The very pressing unsettlement of those days will afterwards
claim a mention; nor should I now omit Disraeli’s sentence
in his <cite>Crisis Examined</cite>, to the effect that “Lord Grey
refusing the Privy Seal and Lord Brougham soliciting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Chief Barony” were “two epigrammatic episodes in the
history of reform that never can be forgotten.”</p>

<p>Mr. John Morley has well observed that about all Disraeli’s
utterance there was something spacious. The ideas that I
am about to examine are not to be brushed away by the
sneers of triflers. Whatever may be thought of them, and
however they may fairly be encountered by criticism, dissented
from or condemned by judgment, they are still alive.
Disraeli bathed the political landscape in a large and luminous
atmosphere. To literature, as I shall hope to show, he lent
a fresh and original charm. Over existence he never ceased
to spread the glow of endeavour, of aspiration, and of purpose.
His heart was with the youth and the labour of England. He
made for the strength and union of every divergent class. He
struck and stirred the national imagination.</p>

<p>Disraeli’s sincerity was that of a master in the world’s
studio, imbuing the fainter shapes around him with the vivid
colours of the true pictures in his own brain. It was that,
also, of a great man of action who translates dreams into deeds.
It is not often that the literary mind is allied to a practical
bent. He himself has reminded us that such an union—“as
in the case of Caius Julius”—is irresistible. He was always
himself, and never under “the dangerous sympathy with the
creations of others.” He believed that “every man performs
his office, and there is a Power, greater than ourselves, that
disposes of all this.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>Disraeli’s European prominence is evidenced through the
space occupied by the polyglot literature relating to him in
the book catalogue alone of the British Museum. It extends
to eleven of those huge pages. His importance at home before
he became pre-eminent is shown by a shower of virulent abuse.</p>

<p>Science assures us that the difference between life and
death is that the former holds the powers of growth and
reproduction, while inanimateness is incapable of either. A
great man is surely one who possesses and imparts these
qualities of life. Disraeli, without question, powerfully
affected the thought of his generation and the destinies of
the future.</p>

<span class="subhead">DEMOCRACY AND REPRESENTATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I</span> wish to head this chapter by a most striking passage
hitherto unquoted. It occurs in the fourth of Disraeli’s
Letters to the Whigs, published in the first numbers
of <cite>The Press</cite>—an organ founded by him in 1853 for the
exposition of his views.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> It unites the brilliance of his youth
to the ripeness of his prime. It is a wonderful forecast of
the future, and it embodies his ideas at a time when the
“Coalition” alliance of Peelites, Whigs, and Manchester
Radicals—one of “suspended opinions”—was entering on the
career which closed so disastrously. In 1833, the “aristocratic”
principle had been crippled. The problem now was
how to bring the new democracy into line with an old
<span class="locked">monarchy—</span></p>

<p>“... I see before me a numerous and powerful party,
animated by chiefs whose opinions in favour of all that can
advance the cause of pure democracy have been openly proclaimed.
Amongst that party no doubt there are some more
moderate than others, some who march blindfold towards the
goal which those of bolder vision see clear through the mists
of faction. But all unite in the march of the caravan towards
the heart of the desert; and if there be those who then discover
that the fountain which allures them on is but the mirage, it
will be too late to return, and it will be destruction to pause....
If England is to retain that empire which she owes to no
natural resources, but to the various influences of a most complicated
and artificial, but most admirable and effective social<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
system, <em>she must gather into one united phalanx all who hold the
doctrine that England, to be safe, must be great</em>. To continue
free, <em>she must rest upon the intermediate institutions that fence
round monarchy, as the symbol of executive force, from that
suffrage of unalloyed democracy</em> which represents the invading
agencies of legislative change. Our system of policy must
be opposed to all those who by rules of arithmetic would
reduce the empire on which the sun never sets to the isle of
the Anglo-Saxon, and leave our shores without defence
against a yet craftier Norman. Our measures of reform
must be so framed as to gain all the purposes of good government,
yet to admit under the name of reform no agency that
tends by its own inevitable laws to the explosion of the
machinery whose operations you pretend it will economise
and quicken.</p>

<p>“By what plausible arguments were the dwellers in the
Piræus admitted to vote in the Athenian assembly?...
Hence from that moment arose the dictator and the demagogue,
... the flatterer and the tyrant of mobs; hence, the
rapid fluctuations, the greedy enterprises, the dominion of the
have-nots, the ruin of the fleet, the loss of the colonies, the
thirty tyrants, the vain restoration of a hollow freedom ...
licence—corruption—servitude—dissolution. Give the popular
assembly of Great Britain up to the <em>controlling</em> influence of
the <em>lowest</em> voters in large towns, and you have brought again a
Piræus to destroy your Athens.”</p>

<p>We shall see ere the close how he foiled the schemes for
representing the refuse of opinion.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>A great statesman is a man inspired by great ideas; and,
since all history is the visible and particular development
of unseen and universal ideas, it must happen that a great
statesman versed in experience and intuition forecasts and
foreknows. For the prophet is the inverted historian or philosopher:
he descries the currents ahead which the other
analyses in retrospect. “To be wise before the event,” urged
Disraeli more than once, “is statesmanship of the highest
order.”</p>

<p>Throughout the preceding century two broad aspects of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
politics, that is to say of applied national energy, present
themselves in England. They were and remain divergent,
but they are and remain mutually instructive and indispensable.</p>

<p>The one regards our kingdom as an elastic society, the
outcome of native habits expressing national temperament;
as a soil of distinctive character and capacity, to which new
plants, if destined to flourish, must be acclimatised, but on
to which, or against which, they must never be forced.</p>

<p>The other—the “philosophic” school—regards the soil as
a mere medium to be exhaustively manured by chemical processes
for the introduction of growths of every origin, as a
sort of “subtropical garden.” It perceives an idea suitable
to other communities or other conjunctures, and immediately
hastens to transplant it. In like manner it perceives an
institution suitable to the race and temper of England, but
unsuitable to some alien race and temper. It is at once for
forcible adoption. It prefers the rigid logic of abstract notions
to the flexibilities of human nature. Its attitude is mechanical
instead of being sympathetic.</p>

<p>The one is in its essence national; the other, if we reflect,
international. The aim of the one is the evolution of
individuality embodied in a nation; that of the other, the
ultimate effacement of nations, and their replacement by
cosmopolitanism.</p>

<p>These are the logical issues of each system. With the
former Burke identified himself, when he recoiled from
following his party into the anti-national abstractions of the
French Revolution. With the latter Mr. Gladstone identified
himself, when he broke loose from the national idea, and advocated
the “right” of every small community to “govern”
itself. The one depends on popular privileges and class
responsibilities evenly distributed—the outcome of national
treaty and compromise, the tact born of struggle, not of
upheaval. The other hinges on inherent “rights,” which are
infinite, ubiquitous, abstract, and indefinite.</p>

<p>Of the former, from first to last, Disraeli, like Canning
before him, was a fearless exponent. “Change,” he said in
his famous Edinburgh speech of 1867, “is inevitable, but the
point is whether that change shall be caused only in deference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
to the manners, the customs, the laws, the traditions of the
people, or whether it shall be carried in deference to abstract
principles and arbitrary and general doctrines.... The
national system, although it may occasionally represent the
prejudices of a nation, never injures the national character,
while the philosophic system, though it may occasionally
improve ... the condition of the country, precipitates progress,
may occasion revolution and destroy states....” His
attitude to the repeal of the Corn Laws depended, as I shall
prove in another chapter, on this dominant idea. It is in close
connection with that idea of personality which I have already
characterised, for nationality is itself the ideal personality
which combines races in communion. It is also in close connection
with that mode of government which seeks salvation
from society and not from the State; and it is bound up with
all the characteristics that distinguish a “nation” from a
“people.” Disraeli’s achievement was to adjust the spirit
of England to the spirit of the age.</p>

<p>Our two parties are, after all, only the strategical forces in
the big campaign of ideas. Without great generals they constantly
tend to forget the issues which nominally enlist them.</p>

<p>At the period when Disraeli first stood on the hustings,
“Reform” had been forced on the Whigs by the “Radicals,”
just as “Repeal” was to be forced some twelve years later on
the Conservatives by the Cobdenites. To be a “Radical” committed
one to neither of the legitimate camps. The Whigs
had entered on their kingdom after long years of hopeless
exclusion. They were bent on engrossing office, and none
detested the new-fangled doctrines more than Lord Grey.
Disraeli’s purpose from the very first was to widen and popularise
Toryism, but never to maintain the exclusive system of
the Whigs in power by the popular machinery to which they
so often resorted. In a purged and quickened Conservatism
lurked irresistible possibilities, true benefit to the nation and
empire at large, and a golden occasion for himself.</p>

<p>I think that if the oil could have blent with the vinegar, if
Peel could ever have coalesced with Lord John Russell,
Disraeli would have had less chance in politics, and must
have been thrown back on literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
His consistency stands out prominent in review. It is one
of ideas. It is only by dint of long retrospect over a whole
career that we can decide in the case of any statesman whether
he has controlled his phases, or drifted with them.</p>

<p>From the first Disraeli compassed his reconciliation of new
ideas with ancient institutions on definite principles, at once
national and constructive, as opposed to destructive and international
theories. He desired it through engraftment, not
uprootal; through the defence and development of a constitution
which is, in fact, the British <em>character</em> expressed by
the modulations of the national voice, and not by the shouts
of mechanical majorities. He wished in every case to preserve
its efficiency by strengthening its tone and enlarging its vents;
while, in the process, he displayed an insight into the instincts
of classes which the conversance of genius with ideas can alone
empower. Of modern, of cosmopolitan “Liberalism,” he said,
as late as 1872, that its drift and spirit were “to attack
the institutions of the country under the name of reform, and
to make war on the manners and customs of the people of
this country under the pretext of progress.”</p>

<p>What then were the “new ideas” and the “old institutions”?</p>

<p>That form of government which is most national will be
best, because the least liable to sudden and social revolutions;
and that form will be most national which is most genuinely
representative; while true representation is one of power distributed,
not centred. It follows that any Government that
does not mirror the nation will break down. This was the
real meaning of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>“... ‘You will observe one curious trait,’ said Sidonia
to Coningsby, ‘in the history of this country—the depository
of power is always unpopular. As we see that the Barons, the
Church, and the King have in turn devoured each other, and
that the Parliament, the last devourer, remains, it is impossible
to resist the impression that this body also is doomed to be
destroyed.’—‘Where then would you look for hope?’—‘In
what is more powerful than laws and institutions, and
without which the best laws and the most skilful institutions
may be a dead letter and the very means of tyranny, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
national character. It is not in the increased feebleness of its
institutions that I see the peril of England; it is in the
decline of its character as a community.... You may
have a corrupt Government and a pure community; you
may have a corrupt community and a pure Administration.
Which would you elect?’—‘Neither,’ said Coningsby,
‘I wish to see a people full of faith, and a Government full
of duty.’”</p>

<p>Are the modern ideas of untempered democracy—Carlyle’s
“despair of finding any heroes to govern you”—compatible
with real representation, as contrasted with the
mechanism of elective systems or the shams of paper constitutions?
Can these ideas ever prove expressive of true
nationality—the <em>character</em> of a united people—as opposed to
the conflicting instincts of unreconciled races, or the factious
claims of divergent groups? Is not the mechanical subordination
to the “State” of Socialism hostile to an individual
“nationality”? How, in the ferment of modern progress,
can the new wine be prevented from bursting the old bottles?
How can government and free action, independence and
inter-dependence, be allied in living reality? How can
opinion be organised into allegiance to leadership? How
can traditions be rendered less formal? How can discipline
and development, authority and elasticity, combine? How
can the machinery of national custom be brought into real
accord with popular aspirations, and the mainstay of character
with the modern speed of movement? “Certainly,”
as Carlyle insisted, “it is the hugest question ever heretofore
propounded to mankind.”</p>

<p>In the proem to the <cite>Revolutionary Epick</cite>, Disraeli says
that the French Revolution marks the greatest political crisis
since the Siege of Troy. The paroxysm of that Revolution
produced two hollow fictions, the “Rights of Man” and “the
Sovereignty of the People.”</p>

<p>Before illustrating the train of Disraeli’s ideas, let me
touch on these two doctrines.</p>

<p><cite>The Rights of Man.</cite> What is the real meaning of a dogma
which annihilates the duties of citizens in declaring the
licence of their “rights;” in affirming personal claims as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
distinguished from popular or legal privileges; in destroying
the community by exalting the person?</p>

<p>It was based on Rousseau’s figment of a “Return to
Nature.”</p>

<p>All “Returns to Nature” are, if we reflect, a harking back
to chaos, a denial of the whole self-developing social state
which God has ordained for man. They are the protests of
instinct against order, of “the People” against “the Nation,”
of isolation against fusion, of “naturalism” against “spiritualism.”
One way or the other, they signify relapses into
brute force and animal conflict.</p>

<p>Rousseau’s “Return” was a <em>sentimental</em> one, for sentimentality
often attends materialism. The best side of
Rousseau was that he did undoubtedly leaven the irreverence
of his generation with some feeling for God. But Rousseau
invented a past on which he founded his hopefulness of
sensibility—an inverted optimism. He cried aloud in
hysterics, “Man is born free; everywhere he is in chains.”
To what freedom was man born? The freedom of confusion.
The order that he evolves is the parent of his true
freedom—the freedom to work and serve, and to receive
justice. The real “Rights of Man” are the rights to justice
that order creates. And if that order belies its name, and
injustice, disorder, masquerade as divine government, why
then Fifth-Monarchy men, French Revolutions, ruining
cataclysm, witness to the heavenly destinies, and order is
born once more. Rousseau’s sobs resembled those of the
hero of French melodrama, who under stage moonshine and
stage misfortune, always ejaculates, “Ma mère!” His mere
emotion worked on nerves of sterner fibre and facts of harder
quality.</p>

<p>Since Disraeli’s death, Nietzsche has propounded a
physical “Return to Nature,” which, however, excludes the
humanitarian side of the French “Equality.” He has sighed
for a gigantic brood of antediluvian anarchs. He has tried
to make anarchy heroic. But a monster is not even a man,
still less a hero.</p>

<p>All such systems must fail, because, as Disraeli has finely
said, “Man is born to adore and to obey.” They contradict<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the spiritual facts of our structure. For the true Right of
Man is to lead wisely and be led loyally in public affairs;
neither to steal nor be stolen from in private. These are
what Carlyle terms his “correctly articulated <em>mights</em>.”
Leadership, loyalty, and social honesty belong to no “state
of nature” of which record or even guess is possible. And
Disraeli agreed with Carlyle when the latter wrote, after the
former had in effect said the same: “... ‘Supply and
demand’ we will honour also; and yet how many ‘demands’
are there, entirely indispensable, which have to go elsewhere
than to the shops!”</p>

<p>But Nietzsche’s theories are luckily untranslatable into
action, and inconsistent with any form of the “state.”
Rousseau’s theories, on the other hand, are the more dangerous
because they are feasible. The “Rights of Man” is a doctrine
absolutely at issue with the “Rights of Nations.” The
abstract notion of universal “rights” is also at variance
with the pressing impulses of physical “wants.” Low wages
and long hours are not redressed by the apparatus of ballot-boxes
or the cant of independence. Physical needs due to
economical causes, which can be modified only by the earnest
statesmanship of leaders rising to their responsibilities, are
not to be dismissed by the vague generalities of “moral
force.” This aspect is powerfully emphasised in <cite>Sybil</cite>.</p>

<p>“... Add to all these causes of suffering and discontent
among the workmen the apprehension of still greater evils,
and the tyranny of the ’butties,’ or middlemen, and it will
with little difficulty be felt that the public mind of this district
was well prepared for the excitement of the political
agitator, especially if he were discreet enough rather to
descant on their physical sufferings and personal injuries,
than to attempt the propagation of abstract political principles
with which it was impossible for them to sympathise.... It
generally happens, however, that where a mere physical
impulse urges the people to insurrection, though it is often an
influence of slow growth and movement, the effects are more
violent and sometimes more obstinate than when they move
under the blended authority of moral and physical necessity,
and mix up together the rights and the wants of man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
The pendant to the “rights” is the “<em>equality</em>” of man.
Here, again, nothing is more self-evident than man’s natural
inequality. The whole development of societies, which we
call civilisation, is for the very purpose of redressing or
relieving these inequalities of occasion, of equipment. By
nature man, like the brute, starts without equality and without
rights. By his “mights” he has created these ideas, and
acquired something of their substance by his superior faculties,
by the spiritual energy which differentiates him. His
“rights” spring from the “law” which he has propagated.
The political equality which he has founded more than compensates
him for the personal inequality of his beginnings.
The “personal equation,” indeed, would imply the reversal
both of his nature and of his craftsmanship; of all conditions,
moreover, compatible with variety of character and freedom
of action. It means, in fact, a denial of the existence of that
natural aristocracy which we find in every class and every
order, and which decides that everywhere the game of
“follow my leader” must be played. What is wanted is a
real aristocracy which “claims great privileges for great purposes.”
What is always dangerous is the monopoly of action
by an aristocracy that shirks its duties, that plays at government,
that is dilettante in leadership or sybarite in life; or
that, as in the three decades preceding the French Revolution,
revenges its exclusion from influence by multiplying
sinecures. It is such a class, as contrasted with individuals—wherever
found—of genuine capacities, that so often evoked
Disraeli’s irony, and has lately been satirised by Mr. Barrie
in a whimsy accentuating the natural inequality of man.
Speaking through the lips of “Egremont,” in that fine passage
where he cheers “Sybil”—the noble daughter of the people,
disappointed by the Charter and the Chartists—with a vista
of the future, Disraeli says: “The mind of England is the
mind ever of the rising race. Trust me it is with the
People.... Predominant opinions are generally the opinions
of the generation that is vanishing.... It will be a product
hostile to the oligarchical system. The future principle of
English politics will not be a levelling principle; not a principle
adverse to privileges, but favourable to their extension.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
<em>It will seek to ensure equality, not by levelling the few, but by
elevating the many.</em>” And again, the great manufacturer,
“Millbank,” in <cite>Coningsby</cite>, is made to remark (after giving distinction
as the basis of aristocracy), “that ‘natural aristocracy’
ought to be found ... among those men whom a nation
recognises as the most eminent for virtue, talents, and property,
and, if you please, birth and standing in the land.
They guide opinion, and therefore they govern. I am no
leveller. I look upon an artificial equality as equally pernicious
with a factitious aristocracy; both depressing and
checking the enterprise of a nation. I like man to be free—really
free; free in his industry as well as his body....” As
Carlyle puts it: “... I say you did not make the land of
England; and by the possession of it you are bound to furnish
guidance and government to England....”—“A high class
without duties to do is like a tree planted on precipices.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>It should not be forgotten, and I shall afterwards illustrate,
that in these and many other respects Carlyle’s teaching chimes
with Disraeli’s. “... That speciosities which
are not realities can no longer be.... What is an aristocracy?
A corporation of the best, of the bravest....
Whatsoever aristocracy does not even attempt to be that,
but only to wear the clothes of that, is not safe; neither
is the land it rules in safe.... We must find a real aristocracy....”
And so with priesthood.</p>

<p>In “Angela Pisani”—a dazzling dream-picture of three
generations in France—by Disraeli’s early intimate, Lord
Strangford, occurs a striking outburst against natural equality,
that solecism in ideas, that remainder biscuit of the French
Revolution.</p>

<p>“... Go and preach equality to the deep seas, ... that
the oyster is equal to the whale or the starfish to the shark;
you will succeed there sooner than you will be able to alter
the relative grades of the five races of humanity. It is a <em>law</em>
which man must unmake himself, ere he can change, that the
Caucasian will aspire as the highest, and the negro will grovel
as the basest.” Disraeli’s attitude was the same in <cite>Contarini
Fleming</cite>:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
“... The law that regulates man must be founded on a
knowledge of his nature, or that law leads him to ruin. What
is the nature of man? In every clime and every creed we
shall find a new definition.... What then? Is the German
a different animal from the Italian? Let me inquire in turn
whether you conceive the negro of the Gold Coast to be the
same being as the Esquimaux who tracks his way over the
Polar snows? The most successful legislators are those who
have consulted the genius of the people.... One thing is
quite certain, that the system we have pursued to attain a
knowledge of man has entirely failed....”</p>

<p>Although “Equality” ignores alike the instinct and the
clue of “race,” it asserts in practice the pandemonium of race-warfare;
because in imagining that man is born equipped, it
ignores his great acquirement of “nationality,” which blends
the reconcilables of “race” into one ideal whole—a league
of common traditions, language, habits, institutions, duties,
and privileges—of “solidarity”—without the bond of blood
or the necessity for bloodshed. Nationality thus brings the
specific qualities of races into the common stock. Disraeli
has often harped on the theme that a “nation” is no “aggregate
of atoms,” but a corporate individuality; and indeed the
force of individuality lies at the root of all his conceptions.
But in truth the whole fiction of “natural equality” springs
from a sort of native envy. As Goethe <span class="locked">sings—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Men stick at reaching what is great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet only grudge an equal state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deem your equals all you know—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No envy worse the world can show.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Crises, according to him in 1833, were determined by causes
far other than these figments of “natural” <span class="locked">laws—</span></p>

<p>“... When I examine the state of European society with
the unimpassioned spirit which the philosopher can alone
command, I perceive that it is in a state of transition—one
from feudal to federal principles. This I conceive to be the
sole and secret cause of all the convulsions that have occurred
and are to occur.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
All this has proved, and is proving true. The civil and
legal “equality” of united nationality and of unifying empire
is replacing the material “equality” of classes or of individuals.</p>

<p>“Natural” equality means “physical” equality, which
was the true gist of the many cries of the French Revolution.
But its hurricane swept away classes and privilege alone;
the “equality” it created, that is to say, was social and civil.
Of civil “equality” Disraeli was always the spokesman; for
in England, civil equality means abolition of monopolies.
Privilege, as the ennobling boon of merit, stands open to all,
and the limits of the political orders or social classes to which
it is attached, are corrected by the wide freedom of public
opinion and discussion. “I hold that civil equality,” said
Disraeli at Glasgow in 1873, “the equality of all subjects
before the law, and a law which recognises the personal rights
of all subjects, is the only foundation of a perfect commonwealth.”
His most striking utterances in <cite>The Press</cite> from
1853 to 1859, and this Glasgow address, are perhaps his most
notable commentaries on this theme.</p>

<p>These are no mere subtleties. “Physical equality” has
exercised a very practical bearing on the doctrines of the
Manchester School and their relations to Sir Robert Peel’s
double reform, above all to those interests of Labour which
both affected. I shall show this in my next chapter.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Suffice
it now to say that Disraeli descried that in adopting the
“Right to physical happiness” doctrine of Manchester, at the
very moment when he unshackled commerce and undid the
Corn Laws, Peel had adopted a principle which logically
demands an “unlimited employment of labour”—a thing
inconsistent at once with his restriction of Labour by
removing the restraints on competition, and, as Disraeli
thought, with the very existence of states and of nations.
Peel thus became unconsciously <em>cosmopolitan</em>, at the very
juncture when he settled commerce and unsettled <span class="locked">labour—</span></p>

<p>“The leading principle of this new school,” explained
Disraeli, treating of “equality” in 1873, “is that there is no
happiness which is not material, and that every living being
has a right to share in that physical welfare. The first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
obstacle to their purpose is found in the rights of private
property. Therefore these must be abolished. But the social
system must be established on some principle, and therefore
for the rights of property they would <em>substitute</em> the rights of
Labour. Now these cannot fully be enjoyed, <em>if there be any
limit to employment. The great limit to employment, to the
rights of Labour, and to the physical and material equality of
man is found in the division of the world into states and nations.</em>
Thus, as civil equality would abolish privilege, social equality
would destroy classes, so material and physical equality
strikes at the principle of patriotism, and is prepared to
abrogate countries.”</p>

<p>It was just this perception that enabled Disraeli nearly
thirty years earlier to predict—as we shall see—so much
that has come and is coming to pass.</p>

<p>The third cry of the French Revolution was <em>Human
Brotherhood</em>. The Christian ideal of inter-nationality, which,
it is to be hoped, may ultimately be realised through the
Brotherhood of Nations, is the Brotherhood of Man under
the Fatherhood of God. But the fraternity of revolution
eliminated both the Brotherhood of Nations and the Fatherhood
of God. The result was a murderous anarchy—a
Brotherhood of Cain.</p>

<p>Such disorders compelled their own cure in their own
country. Although they flooded Europe with opinions at
war with beliefs, and upheld a cosmopolitan model, they
brought the French a deliverer who declined into a despot.
Personality avenged herself. And the eventual remedy for
Napoleonism has in its turn been found in a Republic which,
discarding the sovereignty of man, has also discarded the
sovereignty of God.</p>

<p>The effects of such a government are best perceived in two
recent and remarkable books, M. Demolin’s “À quoi tient la
Supériorité des Anglo-Saxons,” and M. Cerfberr’s “Essai sur
le Mouvement Social et Intellectuel en France depuis 1789.”
The perpetual preponderance of the bourgeoisie has raised a
bureaucracy. The Charter of the Revolution has culminated
in middle-class officialism. The over-centralisation of government
by a few groups, who do not represent the varied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
elements of a great nation, has caused a dearth of individual
initiative, a lack of personal self-reliance and social free-play,
a tendency towards the withering dictatorship of state-socialism,
which underlies the unfitness of France for
colonisation, and which both these acute thinkers depict and
deplore; while the late Professor Mommsen, commenting on
Cæsar’s union of Democracy with Empire, employs the same
arguments.</p>

<p>That state which best represents national character enjoys
the freest play of institutions, favours the finest shape of
spirit, public and private, will wield the most formative
influence among nations, expand the most easily, and propagate
itself by expansion. And the state which best embodies
the national will, is where the legislature is in keenest touch
with the executive, where institutions are organic, where
representation is popular, and where centralisation is foreign
to the national genius. This has, unfortunately, never been
realised in France. She was centralised to an amazing degree
long before her memorable outburst; and De Tocqueville has
well shown that her attempts to unite judicial with legislative
functions were the surest signs of her lack of “solidarity.”
Her great upheaval was predicted by Bolingbroke more than
forty years before it occurred, just because he discerned that
her ancient constitution ignored a popular representation.
De Tocqueville himself, too, only proves that the aristocratic
centralisation of old France has been replaced by the collectivist
centralisation of its new democracy. Both in spirit are
the same. Centralisation, whatever its forms, precludes the
fair and free distribution of activities. It hoards and absorbs
the national character. These are its original sins. But
Disraeli has also pointed out that, for many reasons, France
remains the sole ancient country that can afford to begin again.</p>

<p>So much for the “Rights of Man.” One word still on
“the Sovereignty of the People.”</p>

<p>“A people,” said Disraeli, as early as 1836, in his <cite>Spirit
of Whiggism</cite>, “is a species; a civilised community is a nation.
Now a nation is a work of art and a work of time. A nation
is gradually created by a variety of influences.... These
influences create the nation—these form the national mind.... If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
you destroy the political institutions which these
influences have called into force, and which are the machinery
by which they constantly act, you destroy the nation. The
nation, in a state of anarchy and dissolution, then becomes a
people; and after experiencing all the consequent misery,
like a company of bees spoiled of their queen and rifled of
their hive, they set to again and establish themselves into a
society....”</p>

<p>“The People” is a phrase of physiology, not of politics. It
is an abstruse name for a multitude; it ignores temperament
and will. Stripped of its high sound, its “Sovereignty” means
government by miscellany, the censorship of the census. Its
political bearings are as purely arithmetical as are the corresponding
ethical bearings of the Utilitarian creed; for they
both disregard the many-sided nature of man. Although
derived from the speculations of some late seventeenth-century
republicans in England, the French application of the
theory—Burke’s “Wisdom told by the Head”—was entirely
new. It was not republicanism, the government by qualified
members of ordered classes: it was a despotism by the
crowd as crowd. Such a “Democracy” has never been the
permanent scheme of government in any nation, although
“Liberal opinion” has relied too often on its simplicity.
“One man, one vote,” quantity instead of quality is in truth
no principle at all; and this attempt to confuse the Book of
Wisdom with the Book of Numbers is a feat reserved for
modern periods alone. All earlier systems of democracy were
more or less discriminate, for no indiscriminate state can
cohere, and both freedom and order are based on discrimination.
The Attic Democracy demanded a degraded class of
unleisured, unemancipated slaves. The American Republic,
which has freed serfs and abolished leisure, possesses a
peculiar stability, which will outwear its occasional corruption
because it exists through a landed democracy—one impossible
in overcrowded Europe—as we shall find Disraeli emphasising
in my American chapter.</p>

<p>In a word, the logical outcome of the “Sovereignty of the
People” is the tyranny of plebiscite. But a “plebiscite”
dispenses with the very principle of representation, for where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
all decide equally, why should any be represented? Political
power exercisable by <em>all</em> can only arise when all are sufficiently
qualified. But it is always the <em>some</em>, never the <em>all</em>,
who are competent. Even in their proper sphere of merely
personal choice, how false and fatal most plebiscites have
proved!—“Not this man, but Barabbas.”</p>

<p><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vox populi</i> is only <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vox Dei</i> through the gradual institutions
that nations create; not through the wayward
moods and momentary clamours of “the people.” The whole
problem is how at once to range and to raise public opinion—the
popular conscience; how to preserve moral, without
retarding material, progress; how to inspire “progress” itself
with the conviction that it consists in following the highest
leadership; how, again, to ensure such leadership by the
constant association of duty with privilege, and responsibility
with power; how to recruit it by every means that the spread
of enlightenment can furnish.</p>

<p class="in0">But for this purpose the national imagination must be
reckoned with. “... When that faculty is astir in a nation,”
he has insisted, “it will sacrifice even physical comfort to
follow its impulses.” The struggle will always continue for
national unity, but it takes generations to perceive that
colonial federation, for example, is as requisite a means to
this idea as native institutions representing real elements.
“... A political institution is a machine; the motive power
is the national character,” says “Sidonia;” “Society in this
country is perplexed, almost paralysed. How are the elements
of the nation to be again blended together? In what spirit
is that reorganisation to take place?...”</p>

<p>And again, so late as 1870, in the preface to <cite>Lothair</cite>,
summarising his works, Disraeli observes: “... National
institutions were the ramparts of the multitude against large
estates exercising political power derived from a limited class.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
The Church was in theory—and once it had been in practice—the
spiritual and intellectual trainer of the people. The
privileges of the multitude and the prerogatives of the
sovereign had grown up together, and together they had
waned. Under the plea of Liberalism, all the institutions
which were the bulwarks of the multitude had been sapped
and weakened, and nothing had been substituted for them.
The people were without education, and, relatively to the
advance of science and the comfort of the superior classes,
their condition had deteriorated, and their physical quality as
a race was threatened....”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the incongruity of modern political
machinery was never far from Disraeli’s thoughts. “...
Whatever may have been the faults of the ancient governments,”
he muses in <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite>, “they were in closer
relation to the times, the countries, and to the governed, than
ours. The ancients invented their governments according to
their wants. The moderns have adopted foreign policies, and
then modelled their conduct upon this borrowed regulation.
This circumstance has occasioned our manners and our
customs to be so confused and absurd and unphilosophical....
He who profoundly meditates upon the situation of
modern Europe, will also discover how productive of misery
has been the senseless adoption of Oriental customs by
Northern peoples....” And Disraeli also distinguished between
the direct democracy of multitude and that of “popular”
institutions.</p>

<p>Nothing is less truly “popular” than “the people” as a
“democracy,” for the despotism of many is as odious as
the arbitrary will of one, and even more fatal than the government
by groups of the few. This is the distinction on which
he expatiated in a famous speech of 1847 at Aylesbury, where
he contrasted “popular principles” with “Liberal <span class="locked">opinions”—</span></p>

<p>“As it is not the interest of the rich and the powerful to
pursue popular principles of government, the wisdom of great
men and the experience of ages have taken care that these
principles should be cherished and perpetuated in the form of
institutions. Thus the majesty that guards the multitude is
embodied in a throne; the faith that consoles them hovers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
round the altar of a national Church; the spirit of discussion,
which is the root of public liberty, flourishes in the atmosphere
of a free Parliament.”</p>

<p>These, in the rough, are some of Disraeli’s ideas as to the
new democracy. From the first, as we shall see, he compassed
the renewal of the English democratic idea—that of democracy
as an <em>element</em>—in opposition alike to the State tutelage
of the French, and to that form of democracy which means
the undue power of one <em>class</em> in the nation. His Reform Bill
of 1867 was the accomplishment of his earliest hopes, and the
realisation of principles distinct from the spasms of doctrinaire
“Liberalism.”</p>

<p>He regarded our Constitution—the quintessence of the
English character immanent in English institutions—as a real
though limited monarchy, tempered by a democracy which is
in effect neither more nor less than <em>a natural aristocracy</em>.</p>

<p>“Aristocracy,” as a universal principle and not the
badge of a particular class, is the committal of political
privilege far more to representative influence than to powerful
interests. A “natural” aristocracy must comprehend and
absorb the superiors of every class in all their varieties.</p>

<p>“The Monarchy of the Tories,” Disraeli exclaimed in his
youth,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> “is more democratic than the Republic of the
Whigs.” “The House of Commons,” he exclaimed many
years later, “is a more aristocratic body than the House of
Lords.” In each House, through all its pronouncements, he
recognised that the democratic element is aristocratic, the
aristocratic element democratic. That the representative
assembly of the Commons, which is elected, should include all
that is best from each class which by its qualities has earned
the boon of the franchise; that the representative assembly,
which is not elected, should include more and more not only
those whose aggrandisement stands for the interests of
property, but those too whose intellect and attainments
entitle them to distinction. Nor, of course, can the fact be
ignored that through hereditary honours the Estate of the
Commons, which constantly reinforces the Estate of the
Peers, is, in its turn, as constantly refreshed from the Estate of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
the Peers. And from first to last, in theory, as well as in
action, he upheld the land as the deepest foundation of
England’s greatness of character. I could quote passage
after passage, both from books and speeches, and regarding
subjects the most various, in which he presses home the
substantial importance of a territorial constitution, and the
fact that the landed interest is in truth not only a safeguard
for freedom in peace and vigour in war, but also an industrial
interest of the highest order; and doubly so, because by
sentiment, by tradition, by its contribution to local government,
to stability, to the social scale of duties conditioning
the tenure of property, to physique, its influence is essential
and exceptional. I shall content myself with a citation from
a speech of 1860, and it may be remembered that the acute
De Tocqueville singles out the self-seclusion of the official
bourgeoisie from the land as a chief contributory to the French
<span class="locked">Revolution—</span></p>

<p>“... I look round upon Europe at the present moment,
and I see no country of any importance in which political
liberty can be said to exist. I attribute the creation and
maintenance of our liberties to the influence of the land, and
to our tenure of land. In England there are large properties
round which men can rally, <em>and that in my mind forms the
only security in an old European country against that centralised
form of government which has prevailed, and must
prevail, in every European country where there is no such
counterpoise</em>. It is our tenure of land to which we are indebted
for our public liberties, because it is the tenure of
land which makes local government a fact in England, and
which allows the great body of Englishmen to be ruled by
traditionary influence and by habit, instead of being
governed, as in other countries, by mere police.”</p>

<p>Disraeli was always staunch to the land. After the Corn
Law repeal, he strove pertinaciously till he succeeded in
removing those especial burdens which unfairly hampered
their free competition, and which were originally the price
of peculiar privileges then removed. But though he always
desired a preponderance of the various landed interests, he
never wished for their predominance. And to the last he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
refused to allow any spurious cry for especial measures on
their behalf to be raised when a temporary depression due to
the seasons arose, which he always distinguished from permanent
causes connected with social revolutions.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>To develop our ancient institutions was his lifelong
specific. From his earliest pronouncements, those in the
<cite>Letter to Lord Lyndhurst</cite>, those in <cite>What is he?</cite> and in
<cite>Gallomania</cite>, those in the <cite>Spirit of Whiggism</cite>, those in his
first election speeches, extending over a period of five years
before he was returned, in his three first political novels, to
his latest orations on Conservatism as a “national” cause, he
laid the greatest stress on the function and origin of the
three co-ordinate Estates of the Realm—“popular classes
established into political orders”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>—which under monarchy
form our Constitution. And, while to the end he praised that
mighty force of public opinion which has in the person of the
Press almost divested Parliament of its ancestral office as “the
grand inquest” of national grievances, he still held the “organisation
of opinion” to remain the essence of the party system;
while he increasingly desired the presence in Parliament of
elements at once various and choice,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> and the absence from its
councils of any preponderant sects or sections. Like Burke,
he believed that Parliament should be under every changing
phase of national development “the express image of the
feelings of the nation;” like Bolingbroke, he deemed that it
should be also the collective assemblage of its wisdom. He
regarded these “estates” as the embodiment of great national
interests organised on the principle of distinct duties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
conditioning privilege; and he desired that, however modified,
they should never be altered so as to impair the great national
institutions as whose buttresses they were built to serve.</p>

<p>Looking back historically, he discerned that some hundred
and twenty years before the birth of English Liberalism, a
country and “Old England” party, perplexed by dynastic
and economic problems, confronted too by the semi-scientific
rationalism of a new age, had been first schooled into comprehensive,
generous, and “national” aspirations by a great
but lost leader, and had then been baffled by a set of great
families. Most of these began by professing Republican
principles, and all of them were branded in the literature of
Queen Anne as the “Venetian oligarchy.” These families
aimed steadily for more than a century at engrossing the
whole power of the State. Their bias from 1700 to Sunderland’s
peerage bill in 1718, and from 1718 to the Reform Bill
of 1831 remained Republican. But so long as a king was
content to be a puppet dancing on their wires, and the nation
to be cowed into lethargy, they could dispense with theoretical
forms, mainly upheld as a ladder towards oligarchical power.
From time to time they assumed popular causes, but somehow
they never succeeded in themselves being popular,
because their chief object as a party organisation was “the
establishment of an oligarchical government by virtue of a
Republican cry;”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> because, as Disraeli has again shown,
English revolutions have always been in favour of privilege
traditionally distributed, while foreign revolutions have been
against all privilege whatever; because the “New Whigs” of
Queen Anne and the first two Georges sought a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tabula
rasa</i>—a plain map, as opposed to the picture with perspective
of English institutions. They were theoretically for “liberty
and property”—the “<em>New</em> Whig” catchword of Queen Anne’s
reign that replaced the old one of “Liberty” alone, in which
both Whigs and Tories joined at the revolution—but their
bias was always more for property than for liberty. They
sought to amass money and power through the amassing
classes. They never studied the varied interests of the
whole nation. Walpole usurped their place, but retained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
their influence, and by his virtue George I. reigned rather
than ruled over the towns instead of over the country. At
first these oligarchs kicked against the growing management
of a sole minister, but the shrewd steadiness of a superior
will overmastered them, and Newcastle remained on Walpole’s
side—the insignificant representative of their tamed
confederacy. Trade ceased to follow the land, but tended
more and more to acquire it by purchase, until a fresh
moneyed oligarchy, which acquired fresh titles, was formed.
The great Chatham broke it for a time; and afterwards
George III. obstinately mutinied against its shackles. The
French overthrow transformed the Whig cry of Republicanism
to the Whig cry of Jacobinism. “... Between the
advent of Mr. Pitt and the resurrection of Lord Grey, ...
ever on the watch for a cry to carry them into power, they
mistook the yell of Jacobinism for the chorus of an emancipated
people, and fancied, in order to take the throne by
storm, that nothing was wanting but to hoist the tricolour
and to cover their haughty brows with a red cap. This fatal
blunder clipped the wings of Whiggism; nor is it possible to
conceive a party that had effected so many revolutions and
governed a great country for so long a period more broken,
sunk, and shattered, more desolate and disheartened, than
these same Whigs at the Peace of Paris.” But all proved
fruitless, until at last the vast body of the nation—the real
“people”—reasserted themselves, and, by emphasising
Parliamentary reform, compelled oligarchs, mistrustful of
them at heart,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> to “do something.” What they “did” was
to aggrandise the middle classes, on whom they had always
relied; and a new revolution was the consequence. Throughout
more than a century and a half, despite noble and national
intervals, they constantly betrayed themselves as a “faction
who headed a revolution with which they did not sympathise,
in order to possess themselves of a power which they cannot
wield.” In 1718 they “sought to govern the country by
swamping the House of Commons.” In 1836 they were for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
“swamping” the House of Lords. Their drift was continued
against the national institutions, the conjoined independence
and inter-dependence of which thwarted their inveteracy.
Their plan in the end became avowedly cosmopolitan; and
when that occurred it became doubly dangerous, for to “centralisation”—monopoly
of power—was added the no-principle
of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez-faire</i>,” the abandonment of leadership to chaos.</p>

<p>The great national struggle against Napoleon practically
obliterated party distinctions in England, although there was
still a remnant of those who are, in Burke’s words: “... the
most pernicious of all factions, one in the interest and under
the direction of foreign powers.” A lull ensued. Both Toryism
and Whiggism withered; the first from sheer inanition of
those popular principles which Canning in vain sought to rekindle;
the second from the sheer impossibility of withstanding
the name of Wellington and the memories of Waterloo.
Toryism turned against freedom and Liberalism against order.
Public spirit waned with the decay of party opposition. The
great warriors dwindled into petty place-men until</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Where are the Grenvilles? Turned as usual. Where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friends the Whigs? Exactly where they were;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">until the “Marney” of <cite>Sybil</cite> expired “in the full faith of
dukeism and babbling of strawberry leaves.”</p>

<p>“From that period till 1830,” to resume my citations from
his earliest pamphlets, “the tactics of the Whigs consisted in
gently and gradually extricating themselves from their false
position as the disciples of Jacobinism, and assuming their
ancient post as the hereditary guardians of an hereditary
monarchy.” To ease the transition, they invented Liberalism,
a bridge to regain the lost mainland, and recross on tiptoe
the chasm over which they had sprung with so much precipitation.
“A dozen years of ‘Liberal principles’ broke up the
national party of England—cemented by half a century of
prosperity and glory, compared with which all the annals of
the realm are dim and lack-lustre. Yet so weak intrinsically
was the oligarchical faction, that their chief, despairing to
obtain a monopoly of power for his party, elaborately
announced himself as the champion of his patrician order, and
attempted to coalesce with the Liberalised leader of the Tories.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Had that negotiation not led to the result which was originally
intended by those interested, the Riots of Paris would not
have occasioned the Reform of London. It is a great
delusion to believe that revolutions are ever effected by a
nation. It is a faction, and generally a small one, that overthrows
a dynasty or remodels a constitution. A small party,
strong by long exile from power, and desperate of success
except by desperate means, invariably has recourse to a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup
d’état</i>.... The rights and liberties of a nation can only be
preserved by institutions.... Life is short, man is imaginative,
our passions high.... Let us suppose our ancient
monarchy abolished, our independent hierarchy reduced to
a stipendiary sect, the gentlemen of England deprived of their
magisterial functions, and metropolitan prefects and sub-prefects
established in the counties and principal towns commanding
a vigorous and vigilant police, and backed by an
army under the immediate order of a single House of
Parliament.... But where then will be the liberties of
England? Who will dare disobey London?... When these
merry times arrive—the times of extraordinary tribunals and
extraordinary taxes ... the phrase ‘Anti-Reformer’ will
serve as well as that of ‘Malignant,’ and be as valid a plea
as the former title for harassing and plundering those who
venture to wince under the crowning mercies of centralisation....
I would address myself to the English Radicals.
I do not mean those fine gentlemen or those vulgar adventurers
who, in this age of quackery, may sail into Parliament
by hoisting for the nonce the false colours of the movement;
but I mean that honest and considerable party ... who
have a definite object which they distinctly avow.... Not
merely that which is just, but that which is also practicable,
should be the aim of a sagacious politician. Let the Radicals
well consider whether in attempting to achieve their avowed
object they are not, in fact, only assisting <em>the secret views of
a party whose scheme is infinitely more adverse to their own than
the existing system, whose genius I believe they entirely misapprehend</em>.”
And after commenting on the “preponderance of
a small class” under the new arrangement, the dangerous
tendency towards centralisation and the perils of the reformed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
municipal corporations, he thus concludes: “If there be a
slight probability of ever establishing in this country a more
democratic government than the English Constitution, it will
be as well, I conceive, for those who love their rights, to
maintain that constitution, and if the more recent measures
of the Whigs, however plausible their first aspect, have in fact
been a <em>departure from the democratic character of that constitution</em>,
it will be as well for the English nation to
oppose ... the spirit of Whiggism.”</p>

<p>No student of the Croker Papers can deny that some of
the leading Whigs did in the period immediately succeeding
the Reform Bill plot for a Republican purpose. No
historian will deny that the Reform Bill, by the exclusion of
“Labour” from the franchise, and its deprival at the same
time of the ancient rights which industry had possessed, left
open a rankling sore. In this tract of 1836 Disraeli exposes
the machination and probes the wound. Even thus
early he feared the predominance of a plutocracy, “the
supreme triumph of cash” at an era when, in Carlyle’s phrase
also, “Cash Payment” is fast becoming “the universal sole
nexus of man to man;” while he determined, if ever he had
the power, to redress the balance by including the labouring
classes. In 1848 he had spoken in Parliament on these
questions to the same effect as he had spoken on the hustings
in 1833, even favouring, as he had then advocated, triennial
parliaments, except that under the later circumstances it
might be an unnecessary change; and denouncing, as he had
then denounced, “universal suffrage,” and on the same grounds.
In this remarkable speech he forecasted that signal settlement
which nearly twenty years later he was to secure. I shall
shortly connect many utterances of his, ranging over more
than thirty years; but there are three passages from this
declaration, made at a time before the re-modelling of the
reforms of 1832 had been agreed upon as an open problem,
which I ask leave to excerpt as a prelude, for they strike the very
keynotes of his domestic policy. Disraeli pointed out that
the Radical Hume was taking <em>property</em> as the basis of suffrage
fully as much as the Whigs had done in 1832, and that the
same <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeois</i> predominance would ensue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
“... Now, sir, for one I think property is sufficiently represented
in this House. I am prepared to support the system
of 1832 until I see that the circumstances and necessities of
the country require a change; <em>but I am convinced that when
that change comes, it will be one that will have more regard
for other sentiments, qualities, and conditions than the mere
possession of property as a qualification for the exercise of the
political franchise</em>.” And he then definitely protested against
being ranked among those who accepted finality in that
“wherein there has been, throughout the history of this
ancient country, frequent and continuous change—the construction
of this estate of the realm. I oppose this new
scheme because it does not appear to be adapted in any way
to satisfy the wants of the age, or to be conceived in the
spirit of the times.” He opposed it also because this Radical
motion, like the great Whig measure, really implied the undue
ascendancy of the middle <span class="locked">classes—</span></p>

<p>“... The House will not forget what that class has done in
its legislative enterprises. I do not use the term ‘middle class’
with any disrespect; no one more than myself estimates what
the urban population has done for the liberty and civilisation
of mankind; but I speak of the middle class as of one which
avowedly aims at predominance, and therefore it is expedient
to ascertain how far the fact justifies a confidence in their
political capacity. It was only at the end of the last century
that the middle class rose into any considerable influence,
chiefly through Mr. Pitt,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> that minister whom they are always
abusing.” He proceeds to praise their abolition of the slave
trade: “... A noble and sublime act, but carried with an
entire ignorance of the subject, as the event has proved. How
far it has aggravated the horrors of slavery, I stop not now
to inquire.... The middle class emancipated the negroes,
but they never proposed a Ten Hour Bill.... The interests
of the working classes of England were not much considered in
that arrangement. Having tried their hand at Colonial reform,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
... they next turned their hands to Parliamentary reform,
and carried the Reform Bill. But observe, in that operation
they destroyed, under the pretence of its corrupt exercise, the
old industrial franchise, and they never constructed a new one....
So that whether we look to their Colonial, or their
Parliamentary reform, they entirely neglected the industrial
classes. Having failed in Colonial as well as Parliamentary
reform, ... they next tried Commercial reform, and introduced
free imports under the specious name of free trade.
<em>How were the interests of the working classes considered in this
third movement?</em> More than they were in their Colonial or
their Parliamentary reform? On the contrary, while the
interests of capital were unblushingly advocated, the displaced
labour of the country was offered neither consolation
nor compensation, but was told that it must submit to be
absorbed in the mass. In their Colonial, Parliamentary, and
Commercial reforms there is no evidence of any sympathy
with the working classes; and every one of the measures so
forced upon the country has at the same time proved disastrous.
Their Colonial reform ruined the colonies, and increased
slavery. Their Parliamentary reform, according to
their own account, was a delusion which has filled the people
with disappointment and disgust. If their Commercial reform
have not proved ruinous, then the picture ... presented to
us of the condition of England every day for the last four or
five months must be a gross misrepresentation. In this state
of affairs, as a remedy for half a century of failure, we are
under their auspices to take refuge in financial reform,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> which
I predict will prove their fourth failure, <em>and one in which the
interests of the working classes will be as little considered and
accomplished</em>.”</p>

<p>The third passage concerns the symptoms of a need and
the moment for change. Leaders, he argues, should educate
and prepare the people, and not allow mere agitators to
manufacture grievances, but rather prick the educated and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
well-born to remember the duties by virtue of which alone
they hold their position.</p>

<p>“... A new profession has been discovered which will
supply the place of obsolete ones. It is a profession which
requires many votaries.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“‘Grammaticus, rhetor, geometres, pictor, aliptes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Augur, schœnobates, medicus, magus.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The business of this profession is to discover or invent
great questions. But the remarkable circumstance is this—that
the present movement has not in the slightest degree
originated in any class of the people.... The moral I draw
from all this—from observing this system of organised agitation—this
playing and paltering with popular passions for the
<em>aggrandisement of one too ambitious class</em>—the moral I draw is
this: why are the people of England forced to find leaders
among these persons? The proper leaders of the people are
the gentlemen of England. If they are not the leaders of the
people, I do not see why there should be gentlemen. Yes, it
is because the gentlemen of England have been negligent of
their duties, and unmindful of their station, that the system
of professional agitation, so ruinous to the best interests of
the country, has arisen in England. It was not always so.
My honourable friends around me call themselves the country
party. Why, that was the name once in England of a party
who were the foremost to vindicate popular rights—who were
the natural leaders of the people, and the champions of everything
national and popular.... When Sir William Wyndham
was the leader of the country party, do you think he would
have allowed any chairman or deputy-chairman, any lecturer
or pamphleteer, to deprive him of his hold on the heart of the
people of this country? No, never! Do you think that when
the question of suffrage was brought before the House, he
would have allowed any class who had boldly avowed their
determination to obtain predominance to take up and settle
that question?...”</p>

<p>Nor let him be misconstrued in his views of the ancestral
temperament of the Whigs. Nothing is more remarkable in
the chronicle of combinations than the fact that for more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
a century a party, the most exclusive in its operation, was
considered the least. The recent publications of the Portland
and Harley Papers establish beyond a doubt that while the
“New Whigs” of Queen Anne were in large measure a
commercial syndicate that “made a corner” in power, the old
Whigs of George III. were an aristocratic oligarchy that
subverted rule, both popular and personal, and monopolised
government.</p>

<p>“How an oligarchy,” says Disraeli, in the preface to
<cite>Lothair</cite>, “had been substituted for a kingdom, and a narrow-minded
and bigoted fanaticism flourished in the name of
religious liberty, were problems long to me insoluble, but which
early interested me. But what most attracted my musing, even
as a boy, was the elements of our political parties, and the
strange mystification by which that which was national in its
constitution had become odious, and that which was exclusive
was presented as popular. What has mainly led to this confusion
of public thought, and this uneasiness of society, <em>is our
habitual carelessness in not distinguishing between the excellence
of a principle and its injurious or obsolete application</em>. The
feudal system may have worn out, but its main principle, that
the tenure of property should be the fulfilment of duty, is the
essence of good government. The divine right of kings may
have been a plea for feeble tyrants, but the divine right of
government is the keystone of human progress, and without
it government sinks into police and a nation is degraded into
a mob.” And he continues with reference to the Toryism of
a later period: “... Those who in theory were the national
party, and who sheltered themselves under the institutions of
the country against the oligarchy, had, both by a misconception
and a neglect of their duties, become, and justly become,
odious; while the oligarchy ... had, by the patronage of
certain general principles which they only meagrely applied,
assumed, and to a certain degree acquired, the character of a
popular party. <em>But no party was national; one was exclusive
and odious, and the other liberal and cosmopolitan.</em>”</p>

<p>His history—I speak as a student of the reigns of Queen
Anne and the Georges—will bear scrutiny. Indeed, he
carries the descent of Whiggism some steps further, and traces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
its pedigree back to the Roundhead Independents,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> and even
the favourites of Henry VIII., enriched by the spoil of the
plundered abbeys. But he never denied, or wished to gainsay,
the special and signal qualities of the Whigs’ conspicuous
service. They had reconciled religious liberty to the consecration
of the State, and had constantly proved themselves a
“national” party<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>—that solecism in words but truth in ideas.
This he repeatedly acknowledges. Neither did he ever spare
the soulless, cramped, hollow, and shrivelled Toryism of the
period preceding Bolingbroke’s and Wyndham’s struggle to recall
it to its origins; or again of the period after Pitt’s generous
concessions were overwhelmed by the Jacobin deluge, and
neutralised by the impersonalities of Addington and Perceval;
by the Phariseeism of Liverpool’s puzzle-headedness; by the
pigheadedness of Eldon and Wetherell. Nor did he ever
deny that pseudo-Toryism had often nursed the very vices
of the Whig oligarchy.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> What he did contend, from first to
last, was that any party which by its elements makes for
national growth and union, and favours the free play of custom
in institutions, is “national;” while any party encouraging class
warfare, class preponderance, and cosmopolitan theories repugnant
to the genius of those institutions, will be “anti-national;”
that the democratic possibilities of our constitution must be
spread, as opportunities arise to enlarge the “estate of the
Commons;” yet that this must never mean the enthronement
of either Oligarchy or Democracy in place of our mixed government;
further, that in all such expansion influence is more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
important than interest; that theorisers must never blind us
to the distinction between the “Rights of Man” and the duties
of English citizens, between private and public equality,
between the “Sovereignty of the People” and a national
government; that over-government is a fatal evil, but that
individual leadership is a priceless privilege.</p>

<p>The Reform Act raised the whole question of Representation.
Is its aim monotony or variety? If it is necessarily
elective, must it not logically end in becoming a
plebiscite? Will a vote open to all be prized by any? And
is suffrage any panacea for suffering?</p>

<p>Before the Reform Bill of 1832, Disraeli wrote, musing on
Athens, and contrasting the strong simplicity of Greek literature
with the imitative splendour of Rome, “... A mighty
era, prepared by the blunders of long centuries, is at hand.
Ardently I hope that the necessary change in human existence
may be effected by the voice of philosophy alone; but
I tremble and am silent. There is no bigotry so terrible as
the bigotry of a country that flatters itself that it is philosophical.”
In introducing the great Act of 1867, he observed:
“... The political rights of the working classes which
existed before the Act of 1832, and which not only existed,
but were acknowledged, were on that occasion disregarded
and even abolished, and during the whole period that has
since elapsed in consequence of the great vigour that has
been given to the Government of this country, and of the
multiplicity of subjects commanding interest that have engaged
and engrossed attention, no great inconvenience has
been experienced from that cause. Still, during all that time
there has been a feeling, sometimes a very painful feeling,
that questions have arisen which have been treated in this
House without that entire national sympathy which is
desirable.”</p>

<p>The Reform Bill and its sequels transferred the immemorial
franchise of toilers to the middle classes, who were to be
further aggrandised by the repeal of the Corn Laws.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
raised the revolutionary bitterness of Toil in England and
Religion in Ireland, both of which they provoked to physical
force. The Act proved rather a measure for the House of
Commons than for the Commons themselves. It was the
makeshift and stop-gap of oligarchy in distress. Its immediate
effects were to wipe out that parliamentary opposition on
which the health of party government depends,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> to encroach on
the independent influence of the House of Lords, to end, it is
true unintentionally, the “Venetian Constitution” of those who
enfeebled their cause in 1837 by resolving to continue as
oligarchs when the weapon of oligarchy had vanished; while
none the less it left the monarch a doge, and the multitude
a cipher; a crown still “robbed of its prerogatives, a Church
controlled by a commission, and an aristocracy that does not
lead.” Such were the joint results of the two large and once
great parties that had lost principles in their search after
organisation, the one by thwarting, the other by tricking the
popular voice. It sharpened the warfare between rich and
poor, afterwards aggravated by the acceptance of the principle
of unrestricted competition; it precipitated a plutocracy, it
helped to set class against class, and it became a prop of that
calculating materialism which exalted “utility.” On the other
hand, its indirect benefits were many. “It set men a-thinking”
(I quote from <cite>Sybil</cite>); “it enlarged the horizon of political
experience; it led the public mind to ponder somewhat on the
circumstances of our national history; to pry into the beginnings
of some social anomalies which, they found, were not
so ancient as they had been led to believe, and which had
their origin in causes very different from what they had been
educated to credit; and insensibly it created and prepared a
popular intelligence to which one can appeal, no longer hopelessly,
in an attempt to dispel the mysteries with which for
nearly three centuries it has been the labour of party writers
to involve a national history, and without the dispersion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
which no political position can be understood and no social
evil remedied.” This latter was an especial province of
Disraeli. Carlyle also, as a social regenerator appealing to
higher sanctions than the “useful,” was able to address the
newly awakened “popular intelligence.”</p>

<p>Here again Disraeli is in curious accord with Carlyle, the
difference between them being that Disraeli, a doer as well
as a seer, discerned in the traditional “orders” or “estates”
of the realm real curatives of a sick body politic. Both protested
against a state based on statistics and a progress that
was arithmetical. Both were quick to discriminate, under the
surface of parties, between the influences which made for
cementing and those which made for dissolving the nation.
Both saw in the conservatism and liberalism of the ’thirties,
on the one side a pretence of protecting the forms they enfeebled,
on the other a pretext and a sop for the universal
suffrage which their professions logically implied. Disraeli
perceived that such a French democracy was alien to England,
and meant eventually some sort of unenlightened despotism,
and the aggravation of a government by favouritism and
through interference. He therefore resolved to reinspire the
three “estates”—and if possible the Crown—with reality;
and thus, in extending franchise, to extend it as the privilege
of an order, earned by thrift, education, and intelligence,
while he sought to found it on a basis so stable that leadership
might never sink into being the sport of a fluid and fickle
ignorance. Like Carlyle, he rejoiced that “opinion is now
supreme, and opinion speaks in print; the representation of
the Press is far more complete than the representation of Parliament;”
he hailed the spread of knowledge among the mass
so early as in the <cite>Revolutionary Epick</cite>. But, unlike Carlyle,
he did not deem this increasing power fatal to parliamentary
institutions; indeed, he regarded Parliament as a body privileged
to lead and leaven “opinion,” and one that should
never abandon its proper functions of initiative. Both Parliament
and the Press in his eyes were vents for that free
discussion inseparable from political health, but the one
ought to form a school for statesmen, the other an arena for
critics. And Disraeli also held and enforced that parties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
should never be particularist, but should rest on some national
principle instead of on incoherent prejudices. Parties should
represent broad attitudes towards working institutions. Only
thus can they escape debasement into sets on the one hand,
and shams on the other. If parties are split up into intriguing
factions, they are solvents; if they become merely the masks
of disregarded principles, they grow lifeless and hypocritical.
They are at once “humbug and humdrum.”</p>

<p>In his fine speech of February, 1850, on Agricultural
Distress (a distress greatly due to the unrestricted competition
of English land with foreign acres,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and only to be met
by what he then proposed and long afterwards carried—the
relief of its peculiar burdens), Disraeli dwelt on the sad fact
that the labourers of the land made no appeal to Parliament.
“Why, what is that,” he urged, “but a want of confidence in
the institutions of the country?” Cobden, who definitely and
avowedly sought the predominance of one portion alone,
of middle-class individual interest, gave an ironical cheer.
Carlyle had already published his philippic against Parliament.
But Disraeli—and with justice—continued—</p>

<p>“... The honourable gentleman cheers as if I sanctioned
such doctrines: I have never sanctioned the expression of
such feelings; I never used language elsewhere which I have
not been ready to repeat in this House. I never said one thing
in one place, and another in another. I have confidence in
the justice and wisdom of the House of Commons, although
I sit with the minority; I have expressed that confidence in
other places.... I have expressed the conviction that I
earnestly entertain, that this House, instead of being an
assembly with a deaf ear and a callous heart to the sufferings
of the agricultural body, would, on the contrary, be found to
be an assembly prompt to express sympathy, prompt to
repair, if it might be, even the injury, necessary in the main
as they might think it, which they had entailed on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
agricultural classes of the country.... I have that confidence
in the good sense of the English people that ... they will
deem we are only doing our duty, we are only consulting their
interests in taking every opportunity to alleviate their burdens,
in trying to devise remedies for their burdens; and, if we
cannot accomplish immediately any great financial result, at
least achieving this great political purpose—that we may teach
them not to despair of the institutions of their country.”</p>

<p>This purpose he had sought to accomplish two years
before, when, in 1848, he proved by a speech which, it is said,
won him the eventual leadership of his party, that the breakdown
which Carlyle was at that time preparing to denounce,
was due to an incapable ministry, and not to an effete Parliament.
He always held Parliament to be neither a municipal
vestry nor a chamber of commerce, but a national temple of
embodied opinion; nor can the wisdom of his view in those
dark and despondent times be better tested than by comparing,
in the light of what has since occurred, than by contrasting
Carlyle’s fulminations in this regard with Disraeli’s
discernment.</p>

<p>“... There is a phenomenon,” says Carlyle, in his
“Chartism,” “which one might call Paralytic Radicalism in
these days, which gauges with statistic measuring-reed,
sounds with Philosophic Politico-Economic plummet, the
deep, dark sea of trouble, and, having taught us rightly what
an infinite sea of trouble it is, sums up with the practical
inference and use of consolation, That nothing whatever in it
can be done by man, who has simply to sit still and look
wistfully to ‘Time and General Laws;’ and thereupon,
without so much as recommending suicide, coldly takes its
leave of us....”</p>

<p>Disraeli, on the other <span class="locked">hand—</span></p>

<p>“... ‘In this country,’ said ‘Sidonia,’ ‘since the peace,
there has been an attempt to advocate a reconstruction of
society on a purely rational basis. The principle of Utility
has been powerfully developed. I speak not with lightness
of the labours of the disciples of that school. I bow to
intellect in every form; and we should be grateful to any
school of philosophers, even if we disagree with them....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
There has been an attempt to reconstruct society on a basis
of material motives and calculations. It has failed. It must
ultimately have failed under any circumstances; its failure in
an ancient and densely peopled kingdom was inevitable.
How limited is human reason, the profoundest inquirers are
most conscious. We are not indebted to the reason of man
for any of the great achievements which are the landmarks of
human action and human progress. It was not Reason that
besieged Troy; it was not Reason that sent forth the Saracen
from the desert to conquer the world, that inspired the
crusades, that instituted the monastic order; it was not
Reason that produced the Jesuits; above all, it was not
Reason that created the French Revolution....”</p>

<p>I may compare with this the light episode of the travelling
Utilitarian in the much earlier <cite>Young Duke</cite>—</p>

<p>“... ‘I think it is not very difficult to demonstrate the
<em>use</em> of an aristocracy,’<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> mildly observed the Duke.</p>

<p>“‘Pooh! nonsense, sir! I know what you are going to
say, but we have got beyond all that. Have you read this,
sir? This article on the aristocracy in <cite>The Screw and Lever
Review</cite>?’</p>

<p>“‘I have not, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Then I advise you to make yourself master of it, and
you will talk no more of the aristocracy. A few more
articles like this, and a few more noblemen like the man who
has got this park, and people will open their eyes at last.’</p>

<p>“‘I should think,’ said his Grace, ‘that the follies of the
man who has got this park have been productive of evil only
to himself. In fact, sir, according to your own system, a
prodigal nobleman seems to be a very desirable member of
the commonwealth, and a complete leveller.’</p>

<p>“‘We shall get rid of them all soon, sir....’</p>

<p>“‘I have heard that he is very young, sir,’ remarked the
widow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
“‘Ah, youth is a very trying time! Let us hope the
best. He may turn out well yet, poor soul!’</p>

<p>“‘I hope not. Don’t talk to me of poor souls. There is
a poor soul,’ said the Utilitarian, pointing to an old man
breaking stones on the highway. ‘That is what I call a poor
soul, not a young prodigal....’”</p>

<p>No one who has followed the labour movement in England,
or the social-democrat organisations in Germany and
France, can fail to recognise the immense part that personality,
imagination, and desire of power plays in them, and
how completely, in their instance, utilitarianism has broken
down. Utilitarianism, of course, ignores the moral and
imaginative aspects. It mistakes the moon for a cream-cheese.
It ignores personal influence. Above all, it confounds
happiness with prosperity. “Charcoal,” exclaims
Ruskin (here in complete accord with Disraeli), “may be
cheap among your roof-timbers after a fire, and bricks may
be cheap in your streets after an earthquake; but fire and
earthquake may not therefore be national benefits.” Even in
a concern purely commercial, reserve must be weighed
against dividends.</p>

<p>Again, as regards this very Reform Bill of 1832, and the
stagnant formulæ of its pioneer, I will again invoke <span class="locked">Carlyle—</span></p>

<p>“... An ultra-radical, not seemingly of the Benthamee
species, is forced to exclaim, ‘The people are at last wearied!
They say, “Why should we be ruined in our shops, thrown out
of our farms, voting for these men?” Ministerial majorities
decline; this Ministry has become impotent, had it even the
will to do good. They have long called to us, “We are a
Reform Ministry; will ye not support <em>us</em>?” We have
supported them, borne them forward indignantly on our
shoulders time after time, fall after fall, when they had been
hurled out into the street, and lay prostrate, helpless, like
dead luggage. It is the fact of a Reform Ministry, not the
name of one, that we would support.... The public mind
says at last, Why all this struggle for the <em>name</em> of a Reform
Ministry? Let the Tories be a ministry, if they will; let, at
least, some living reality be a ministry!’...”</p>

<p>Let me illustrate Carlyle by two further passages from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Disraeli. The first concerns parties in 1837, the second
concerns the withered and withering Toryism left to confront
the hollow conventions of the Reform Ministry. He is arguing
that “the man who enters public life at this epoch has to
choose between political infidelity and a destructive creed.”</p>

<p>“... The principle of the <em>exclusive</em> constitution of England
having been conceded by the Acts of 1827–28–32, ... a
party has arisen in the State who demand that the principle
of political liberalism shall consequently be carried to its
extent, which it appears to them is impossible without getting
rid of the fragments of the old constitution that remain.
This is the destructive party—a party with distinct and
intelligible principles. They seek a specific for the evils of
our social system in the general suffrage of the population.
They are resisted by another party who, having given up
exclusion, would only embrace as much liberalism as is
necessary for the moment; who, without any embarrassing
promulgation of principles, wish to keep things as they find
them as well as they can; but, as a party must have the
semblance of principles, they take the names of the things
that they have destroyed. Thus they are devoted to the
prerogatives of the Crown, although in truth the Crown has
been stripped of every one of its prerogatives; they affect a
great veneration for the constitution in Church and State,
although every one knows that it no longer exists; they are
ready to stand or fall with the independence of the Upper
House of Parliament, although in practice they are perfectly
well aware that, with their sanction, the ‘Upper House’ has
abdicated its initiatory functions, and now serves only as a
court of review of the legislation of the House of Commons.
Whenever public opinion, which this party never attempts to
form, to educate, or to lead, falls into some violent perplexity,
passion, or caprice, this party yields without a struggle to the
impulse, and, when the storm has passed, attempts to obstruct
and obviate the logical, and ultimately the inevitable results
of the very measures they have themselves originated, or to
which they have consented. This is the Conservative party.
I care not whether men are called Whigs or Tories, Radicals
or Chartists, ... but these two divisions comprehend at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
present the English nation.... With regard to the first
school, I for one have no faith in the remedial qualities of a
Government carried on by a neglected democracy, who for
three centuries have received no education. What prospect
does it offer us of those high principles of conduct with which
we have fed our imagination and strengthened our will? I
perceive none of the elements of government that should
secure the happiness of a people and the greatness of a realm....
Many men in this country ... are reconciled to the
contemplation of democracy, because they have accustomed
themselves to believe that it is the only power by which we
can sweep away <em>those sectional privileges and interests that
impede the intelligence and industry of the community</em>, ... and
yet the only way ... to terminate what, in the language of
the present day, is called class legislation, <em>is not to entrust
power to classes</em>. You would find a ‘locofoco’<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> majority as
much addicted to class legislation as a factitious aristocracy....
In a word, <em>true wisdom lies in a policy that would effect
its ends by the influence of opinion, and yet by the means of
existing forms</em>.”</p>

<p>And the <span class="locked">other—</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Rigby began by ascribing everything to the Reform
Bill, and then referred to several of his own speeches on
Schedule A. Then he told Coningsby that want of ‘religious
faith’ was solely occasioned by want of churches, and want of
loyalty by George IV. having shut up himself too much at
the cottage in Windsor Park, entirely against the advice of
Mr. Rigby. He assured Coningsby that the Church Commission
was operating wonders.... The great question now
was their architecture. Had George IV. lived, all would have
been right. They would have been built on the model of the
Buddhist pagoda. As for loyalty, if the present king went
regularly to Ascot races, he had no doubt all would go right.
Finally, Mr. Rigby impressed on Coningsby to read the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite> with great attention, and to make himself
master of Mr. Wordy’s “History of the Late War,” in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
twenty volumes—a capital work which proves that Providence
was on the side of the Tories.’...”</p>

<p>As regards the principles and conduct of the Reform
Ministers themselves, years before he entered Parliament, in
that brilliant series of speeches on the hustings of High
Wycombe and Taunton, which preluded so many of his ideas,
he denounced the incompleteness of the measure and the inadequacy
of the men. In 1832 he <span class="locked">said—</span></p>

<p>“... If, instead of filling the humble position of a private
individual, I held a post near the person of my King, I should
have said to my sovereign, ‘Oppose all change, or allow that
change which will be full, satisfactory, and final.’ In the
change produced by the professing party now in power, there
are omissions of immense importance. These points they
promised; these points they have not given you; and now,
after all their protestations, they turn round and ask how the
people can have the audacity to demand them.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>In 1834 he denounced “the Whig system of centralisation,”
and their organised attempt to “overpower” the House
of Lords and to despotise the House of Commons, while of
their subsequent disorganisation from within, because of the
failure of concerted opposition from without, he gave that
surpassing simile of Ducrow’s Circus. In 1835 he pursued
the subject of constitutional opposition, and he expressed his
dread, as he did in 1881, that if the Whigs remained “our
masters for life, the dismemberment of the Empire” might
follow. And all this in the teeth of what was then considered
a system installed for fifty years, and which would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
promised him a personal triumph had he appeared then to
have chosen to have endorsed it.</p>

<p>But the views he always retained as to the first principles
of representation are best heard in a passage from <cite>Coningsby</cite>.</p>

<p>“... In the protracted discussions to which this celebrated
measure gave rise, nothing is more remarkable than the perplexities
into which the speakers on both sides are thrown
when they touch upon the nature of the representative principle.
On the one hand, it was maintained that under the
old system the people were virtually represented, while, on
the other, it was triumphantly urged that, if the principle
was conceded, the people should not be virtually, but actually
represented. But who are the people? And where are you
to draw a line? And why should there be any? It was
urged that a contribution to the taxes was the constitutional
qualification for the suffrage.” Here is repeated what he had
urged in the ’thirties, and was to reiterate in the ’fifties, that
indirect taxation is as much taxation as direct; that “the
beggar who chews his quid as he sweeps a crossing is contributing
to the imposts; ... he is one of the people, and he
yields his quota to the public burthens.” The logical inference
of such a qualification must be to convert the suffrage from
being a privilege into being a right. Manhood suffrage, in
common with all privilege unearned, is usually prized by none,
and even disregarded by most.</p>

<p>“Amid these conflicting statements,” he continues, “it is
singular that no member of either House should have
recurred to the original character of these popular assemblies
which have always prevailed among the northern nations....
When the crowned northman consulted on the welfare of his
kingdom, he assembled the estates of his realm. Now, an
estate is a class of the nation invested with political rights.
Then appeared the estate of the clergy, of the barons, of
other classes. In the Scandinavian kingdoms to this day
the estate of the peasants sends its representatives to the Diet.
In England, under the Normans, the Church and the Baronage
were convoked together with the estate of the Community,
a term which then probably described the inferior holders
of land whose tenure was not immediate of the Crown.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
The Third Estate was so numerous that convenience suggested
its appearance by representation, while the others,
more limited, appeared, and still appear, personally. The
Third Estate was reconstructed as circumstances developed
themselves. It was a reform of Parliament when the towns
were summoned. In treating the House of the Third Estate
as the House of the People, and not as the House of a
privileged class, the Ministry and Parliament of 1831
virtually conceded the principle of universal suffrage. In
this point of view, the ten-pound franchise was an arbitrary,
irrational, impolitic qualification. It had indeed the merit of
simplicity, and so had the constitution of Abbé Sièyes. But
its immediate and inevitable result was Chartism.</p>

<p>“But if the Ministry and Parliament of 1831 had announced
that the time had arrived when the Third Estate should be
enlarged and reconstructed, they would have occupied an
intelligible position; and if, instead of simplicity of elements
in its reconstruction, they had sought, on the contrary, varying
and various materials which would have neutralised the
painful predominance of any particular interest in the new
scheme, and prevented those banded jealousies which have
been its consequence, the nation would have found itself in a
secure position. Another class, not less numerous than the
existing one, and invested with privileges not less important,
would have been added to the public estates of the realm, and
the bewildering phrase, ‘the People,’ would have remained
what it really is, a term of natural philosophy, and not of
political science.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The quality, then, of excellence, instead of the majorities
of multitude, the variety of every approved influence, and not
the undue weight of any overwhelming interest—these formed
for him the true bases of representation. He was ever for
levelling up instead of down; and, as we shall see, he was
directly opposed to Mr. Hume’s fallacy (still rampant) that
by our traditions representation depends only on taxation.</p>

<p>These ideas animated him throughout, and he achieved
them in 1867, not, though it has been insinuated, by filching
the proposals of his predecessors, but on the opposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
principles which he continued to advocate from the ’thirties
to the ’sixties. In 1835, two years before he entered Parliament,
he expressed the same convictions in his <cite>Spirit of
Whiggism</cite>. He showed that the two Houses were the
“House of the Nation,” not the “House of the People,” but
that both alike represent the “Nation.” He proceeded to
prove by powerful illustration that, under whatever assumed
form, political power will follow the distribution of property.
He emphasised the “passion for industry” as an instrument
of wealth as an English characteristic hostile to any future
revolution in the distribution of property. He proved that in
England revolution is ever a struggle for privilege, in Europe
one against it; and he concluded, therefore, that “... If a
new class rises in the State, it becomes uneasy to take its
place in the natural aristocracy of the land.... <em>The Whigs in
the present day have risen on the power of the manufacturing
interest. To secure themselves in their posts, the Whigs have
given the new interest an undue preponderance.</em> But the new
interest has obtained its object and is content.... The
manufacturer begins to lack in movement. Under Walpole the
Whigs played the same game with the commercial interest.
A century has passed, and the commercial interests are all as
devoted to the Constitution as the manufacturers soon will
be.... The consequence of our wealth is an aristocratic
constitution, <em>founded on an equality of civil rights</em>. And
who can deny that an aristocratic constitution resting on
such a basis, where the legislative and even the executive
office may be obtained by every subject of the realm, <em>is in
fact a noble democracy</em>?”</p>

<p>These are no dry theories, but surely a true version of
growing facts. Our Constitution <em>is</em> that of a natural
aristocracy founded on popular privilege depending on the
mutual exercise of duties. This free aristocracy distributes
its power through the estates of the realm, and these orders
should accord with the institutions to which they have given
rise; for, as Disraeli said in 1852, they are “popular” without
being absolutely “democratic.” When any one of them
degenerates into undue monopoly, the whole body must
suffer; and should such a catastrophe attain any permanence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
one of the great institutions through which English nationality
thrives would be shattered by the very order to which it corresponds.
What Disraeli observes of the eventual reduction
of each new ascendant interest to aristocratic influence, is
beyond question. But that influence must rest on the due
performance of civil and social responsibilities which empower
it. Stripped of historical verbiage, the “constitution” harmonises
classes through special privileges and reciprocal duties.
Of the “middle-middles” he always spoke with respect, of the
“lower-middles” with much sympathy, not least as victims
of the income-tax;<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> but he ever doubted their governing
capacity as a class; and when Sir Robert Peel’s “monarchy
of the middle classes” came into swing, Disraeli feared the
plutocracy which has happened, and which, when financial, is
more easily freed from political responsibility. The choice
offered between wealth omnipotent and mob-despotism, is a
choice between Scylla and Charybdis. To obviate it, Disraeli
created in 1867 an artisan franchise, accorded as a boon at
length earned by character and intelligence, and based on the
<em>rating</em> principle, which affords a pledge of permanence; at the
same time, he strove to countervail the growing irresponsibility
of wealth by relieving unprotected land of its burdens and
unrepresented labour of its degradation. By the first, he
strove to retain that sap of the soil which underlies the
English character, the English health, the English order,
through local government, the English freedom, and the
English steadiness; for (and this was said in 1852), “...
Laws which, by imposing unequal taxes, discourage that
investment (<i>i.e.</i> capital invested in land, the return for which
is rent) are, irrespective of their injustice, highly impolitic;
for nothing contributes more to the enduring prosperity of a
country than the natural deposit of its surplus capital in the
improvement of its soil....” By the last, he tried to redress
that social misery which the measures of 1846 had not removed
and had even increased: the overcrowding of the towns,
the displacement of labour, the subsidising of foreign agriculture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
to the decultivation of English land, the enthronement of
Mammon and materialism—all denounced and foreseen by
him with wonderful prescience. Very soon after the repeal
of the Corn Laws, discerning, as Disraeli did, its drift of
denationalising tendencies, its certainty of some social and
physical demoralisation, as well as the possible changes in
European competition which might necessitate another
“commercial and social revolution,” he inveighed against the
inference that “we are to be rescued from the alleged power
of one class, only to fall under the avowed dominion of
another;” he believed that “the monarchy of England, its
sovereign power mitigated by the acknowledged authority of
the estates of the realm, has its root in the hearts of the
people, and is capable of securing the happiness of the nation
and the power of the State.” His peroration—some of which
I shall give in the next chapter—is a noble flight of hope.
He discerned at once that the transformation scene of 1846
would affect society more than politics, and that the next
extension of the franchise must consequently prove a social
antidote as well as a social sedative.</p>

<p>In 1839, refuting Mr. Hume’s hobby already alluded to,
he showed that the theory is nowhere inherent in our Constitution,
but is a doctrinaire supplement of alien origin; that the
“Commons” are a political order invested with power for the
performance of duties, just as the Peers are a similar order,
but needing no representation; he re-urged that the House of
Commons was the representative of the “nation”—an organic
whole, and not of the “people”—a vague abstraction. He had
even then already pointed out that, historically, the delegates
before the Restoration had perverted the national traditions by
announcing, more than a century before the French Revolution,
the sovereignty of the “people.” He once more stoutly denied
that “taxation and representation went hand-in-hand” according
to our constitution. There was representation without
election, as in the case of the Church in the Lords, for the Crown
appointed the bishops, not the clergy. And as regards taxation,
it was indirect, as well as, unfortunately, direct. In the same
year, protesting against Lord John Russell’s assumption of a
“monarchy of the middle classes,” Disraeli repeated that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
this country “the exercise of political power must be associated
with great public duties,” just as in 1846, when justifying the
burdens on land so long as protection was accorded it, he
asserted that great honours demand great burdens. Again, in
1848, Disraeli, opposing Mr. Hume once more, and protesting
against the finality of the reconstruction of 1832, even before
Lord John Russell declared the question free for both parties
in 1853 and 1856—strongly condemned the radical scheme
just because it did not “... enable the labouring classes to
take their place in the Constitution of the country.” “If there
be any mistake,” he said, “more striking than another in the
settlement of 1832, ... it is, in my opinion, that the bill of
1832 took the qualification of <em>property</em> in too hard and rigid
a sense, as the only qualification which should exist in this
country for the exercise of political rights.” In 1852, he again
dinned into unappreciative ears the necessity for a genuinely
industrial franchise, though he was not satisfied that Lord John
Russell’s £5 franchise would so operate. In 1859 and 1867,
Disraeli tried hard to confer franchises on education and
thrift, but Mr. Bright sneered at them as “fancy franchises,”
Mr. Gladstone scoffed at them, and in forwarding the great
measure of labour suffrage by the compelled co-operation of
both sides of the House, Disraeli had to surrender safeguards
he never ceased to desire and to regret, for they are founded
on the State recognition of individual excellence, instead of
on the State manipulation of mere party mechanism.</p>

<p>“Is the possession of the franchise,” demanded Disraeli in
1851, “to be a privilege, the privilege of industry and public
virtue, or is it to be a right—the right of every one, however
degraded, however indolent, however unworthy?... I am
for the system which maintains in this country <em>a large and
free Government, having confidence in the energies and faculties
of man</em>. Therefore I say, make the franchise a privilege, but
let it be the privilege of <em>the civic virtues</em>. Honourable gentlemen
opposite would degrade the franchise to the man, instead
of raising the man to the franchise. If you want to have a free
aristocratic country, free because aristocratic (I use the word
‘aristocratic’ in its noblest sense—<em>I mean that aristocratic freedom
which enables every man to achieve the best position in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
State to which his qualities entitle him</em>), I know not what we can
do better than adhere to the <em>mitigated monarchy of England,
with power in the Crown, order in one estate of the realm, and
liberty in the other</em>. It is from that happy combination that
we have produced a state of society that all other nations look
upon with admiration and envy.”</p>

<p>In all these considerations, the social results of measures
and formulæ were ever uppermost in his mind. What he had
ever been resolute to secure was, as he avowed even in 1850,
“the industrial franchise,” which the resettlement of 1832
had thrown to the winds.</p>

<p>Again, in 1865, “... It appears to me,” urged Disraeli,
“that the primary plan of our ancient constitution, so rich in
various wisdom, indicates the course that we ought to pursue
in this matter. It secured our popular rights by entrusting
power, not to an indiscriminate multitude, but to the estate, or
order, of the Commons. And a wise government should be
careful that the elements of that estate <em>should bear a close
relation to the moral and material development of the country</em>.
Public opinion may not yet, perhaps, be ripe enough to
legislate as to the subject, but it is sufficiently interested in
the question to ponder over it with advantage; so that, <em>when
the time comes for action</em>, we may legislate in the spirit of the
English Constitution, <em>which would absorb the best of every
class</em>, and not fall into a ‘democracy’ which is the tyranny of
one class, and that <em>one the least enlightened</em>.”</p>

<p>Long before 1867, these continuous utterances culminated
that typical speech of 1859, which mooted a comprehensive
plan of enlarged representation of political power, yet undisturbed
balance, and which would have made “a representative
assembly that is a mirror of the mind as well as of the
material interests of England.”</p>

<p>I shall quote largely from this unfamiliar speech. It
illustrates how far his lifelong principles applied to a juncture
before the artisans were wholly free from agitation against
monarchy, and those institutions which fence it round. All
Radical schemes, compassing “manhood suffrage,” all Whig
schemes, merely delaying its day by seeking to reduce rental
or property qualifications to an arbitrary minimum, were his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
aversion. Set, as he always was, against including whatever
at the moment formed the dregs of ignorance, or the sediment
of an unentitled populace, he already favoured that “rating”
basis which Lord John Russell, always constitutional, had
himself propounded in his abortive plan of 1854, and which
Disraeli was to carry out in 1867 as a safeguard of stability in
the boroughs. But in 1859 Lord Derby did not consider its
application feasible. Disraeli had, therefore, now to forego it.
Refusing to make any reductions in the franchise, or yield an
inch to “detached” democracy, he now proposed to attain
steadiness, to vary the vote, and to represent enlightenment
contrasted with mere property by recommending the creation
of the “compound householder” (“dwellers in a portion of any
house rented in the aggregate at £20”)<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>; by a new suffrage
for several small ownerships of property in the funds and
savings banks; and for education, by enfranchising graduates,
ministers of religion, physicians, barristers, and certain school-masters.
He thus both forecasted, so far as was then practicable,
household suffrage as against household democracy; and
at the same time sought to represent education and ensure
variety. By his attendant scheme of redistribution, he tried
to prevent the counties from being “swamped” by the towns,
while at the same time he jealously guarded the local independence
of the boroughs. His purpose was to protect
the country districts against that invasion from the cities of
agrarian demagogues which, after his death, the stride forward
of 1884 was to impel.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>But “finality is not the word of politics.” Progress
changes possibilities. He had to wait till the pear was ripe;
till the working man had been really reconciled to monarchy
and its institutions; till the ground had been laid for a
generous scheme of national education, and cleared by the
sharply defined position of parties, which at last brought into
relief the issues between democracy as a due element and as
a domineering class. Nor, if he were now alive, would he fail
to discern that the appeal of present imperialism to present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
democracy will be dangerous if made to it as a deciding class
before it has acquired the governing faculty by long apprenticeship.
Democracy as a leaven, democracy as the lump,
are obviously distinct. The one is “popular and national,”
the other despotic or cosmopolitan. Our artisans are now
intensely national and patriotic; but the “submerged tenth”
would soon show themselves tyrants over the community.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The pith of his argument is that mere numbers can never
form the ground of representation, which should rest on
influence even more than interest.</p>

<p>“... It appears to me that those who are called parliamentary
reformers may be divided into two classes. The
first are those ... who would adapt the settlement of 1832
to the England of 1859, and would act in the spirit and
according to the genius of the existing constitution.... But,
sir, it would not be candid, and it would be impolitic not to
acknowledge that there is another school of reformers having
objects very different from those which I have named. The
new school, if I may so describe them, would avowedly effect
a parliamentary reform on principles different from those which
have hitherto been acknowledged as forming the proper
foundations for this House. The new school of reformers are
of opinion that the chief, if not the sole, object of representation
is to realise the opinion of the numerical majority of the
country. Their standard is <em>population</em>, and I admit that their
views have been clearly and efficiently placed before the
country. Now, sir, there is no doubt that population is, and
must always be, one of the elements of our representative
system. There is also such a thing as property, and that
too must be considered. I am ready to admit that the
new school have not on any occasion limited the elements
of their representative system solely to population. They
have, with a murmur, admitted that property has an equal
claim to consideration; but then, they have said that <em>property
and population go together</em>. Well, sir, population and property
do go together—in statistics, but in nothing else. Population
and property do not go together in politics and practice. I
cannot agree with the principles of the new school, either if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
population or property is their sole, or if both together constitute
their double, standard. I think the function of this
House is something more than merely to represent the population
and property of this country. <em>This House ought, in my
opinion, to represent all the interests of the country.</em> Now, those
interests are sometimes antagonistic, often competing, always
independent and jealous; yet they all demand a distinctive
representation in this House, and how can that be effected,
under such circumstances, <em>by the simple representation of the
voice of the majority, or even by the mere preponderance of property</em>?
If the function of this House is to represent all the
interests of the country, you must, of course, have a representation
scattered over the country, because interests are
necessarily local. An illustration is always worth two arguments;
permit me, therefore, so to explain my meaning, if it
requires explanation. Let me take the two cases of the
metropolis and that of the kingdom of Scotland.... Their
populations are at this time about equal. Their respective
wealth is very unequal.... There is between them the annual
difference in the amounts of income upon which the schedules
are levied of that between £44,000,000 and £30,000,000. Yet
who would for a moment pretend that the various classes and
interests of Scotland could be adequately represented by the
same number of members as represent the metropolis? So
much for the population test. Let us now take the property
test.... The wealth of the city of London is more than
equivalent to that of twenty-five English and Welsh counties
returning forty members, and of 140 boroughs returning 232
members. The city of London, the city proper, is richer than
Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham put together.... It
is richer than Bristol, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield, Hull,
Wolverhampton, Bradford, Brighton, Stoke-upon-Trent,
Nottingham, Greenwich, Preston, East Retford, Sunderland,
York, and Salford combined—towns which return among them
no less than thirty-one members. Yet the city of London has
not asked me to insert it in the bill, which I am asking leave
to introduce, for thirty-one members.... So much ... for the
property test.... But the truth is, that <em>men are sent to this
House to represent the opinions of a place; and not its power</em>....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
“Why, sir, the power of the city of London or that of the
city of Manchester in this House is not to be measured by the
honourable and respectable individuals whom they send here
to represent their opinions. I will be bound to say that there
is a score—nay, that there are threescore—members in this
House who are as much and more interested, perhaps, in the
city of Manchester than those who are in this House its
authoritative and authentic representatives.... Look at the
metropolis itself, not speaking merely of the city of London.
Is the influence of the metropolis in this House to be measured
by the sixteen honourable members who represent it?...
... So much for that principle of population, or that principle
of property, which has been adopted by some; or that
principle of population and property combined, which seems
to be the more favourite form.... There is one remarkable
circumstance connected with the new school, who would build
up our representation on the basis of a numerical majority,
and who take population as their standard. It is this—that
none of their principles apply <em>except in cases where population
is concentrated</em>. The principle of population is ... a very
notorious doctrine at the present moment, but it is not novel....
It was the favourite argument of the late Mr. Hume....
The principle, in my opinion, is false, and would produce results
dangerous to the country and fatal to the House of Commons.
But if it be true, ... then I say you must arrive at conclusions
entirely different from those which the new school has
adopted. If population is to be the standard, and you choose
to disfranchise small boroughs and small constituencies, it is
not to the great towns you can, according to your own principles,
transfer their members....</p>

<p>“Let us now see what will be the consequence if the
population principle is adopted. You would have a House,
generally speaking, formed partly of great landowners and
partly of great manufacturers. I have no doubt that, whether we
look to their property or to their character, there would be no
country in the world which could rival in respectability such
an assembly. But would it be a House of Commons; would
it represent the country; would it represent the various interests
of England? Why, sir, after all, the suffrage and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
seat respecting which there is so much controversy and contest,
<em>are only means to an end.... You want in this House
every element that obtains the respect and engages the interest
of the country.... You want a body of men representing the
vast variety of the English character; men who would arbitrate
between the claims of those great predominant interests;
who would temper the acerbity of their controversies. You
want a body of men to represent that considerable portion of the
community who cannot be ranked under any of those striking
and powerful heads to which I have referred, but who are in
their aggregate equally important and valuable, and perhaps as
numerous.</em>”</p>

<p>He then adverted to the borough system as an indirect
machinery for this purpose, and contended that those who
would sweep it away must substitute “machinery as effective.”
“... Now,” he continued, “there is one remarkable
feature in the agitation of the new school.... They offer
no substitute whatever.... I will tell you what must be the
natural consequence of such a state of things. The House
will lose, as a matter of course, its hold on the Executive.
The House will assemble. It will have men sent to it, no
doubt, of character and wealth; and having met here, they
will be unable to carry on the Executive of the country.
Why? Because the experiment has been tried in every
country, and the same result has occurred; <em>because it is not
in the power of one or two classes to give that variety of character
and acquirement by which the administration of a country
can be carried on</em>. Well, then, what happens? <em>We fall back
on a bureaucratic system</em>,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> and we should find ourselves, after
all our struggles, in the very same position from which, in
1640, we had to extricate ourselves. Your administration
would be carried on by a court minister, perhaps by a court
minion. It might not be in these times, but in some future
time. The result of such a system would be to create an
assembly where the members of Parliament, though chosen
by great constituencies, would be chosen from limited classes,
and perhaps only from one class of the community....” His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
own prescription for breaking monotony, he described as
“lateral,” not “vertical” extension.</p>

<p>Disraeli determined to settle this question himself, and
to settle it by the admission to the franchise of the “working”
classes of the country, and not by lowering it to the
“man in the street,” or the submerged tenth. In these views
he followed the Toryism of Cobbett rather than the Radicalism
of Hume. Discussing Lord John Russell’s proposals of
1860 “for the representation of the people” (which, though
it adopted the principle of rateability, was, in fact, merely a
reduction of the borough franchise to £6, and of the county
occupation to £10), Disraeli labelled its “simplicity” as “of
a mediæval character, but without any of the inspiration of
the feudal system, or any of the genius of the middle ages.”
It sought only to scale down a property qualification. The
“claims of intelligence, acquirement, and education” were
ignored. As regarded the borough franchise, not fitness, but
number was the principle; and the numerical addition
accrued to one class only.</p>

<p>“... Let us now consider,” Disraeli continued, “whether
the particular class upon whom the noble lord is about to
confer this great political power, are a class who are incapable,
or who are unlikely to exercise it. Are they a class who have
shown no inclination to combine? Are they a class incapable
of organisation? Quite the reverse. If we look to the
history of this country during the present century, we shall
find that the aristocracy, or upper classes, have on several very
startling occasions shown a great power of organisation. <em>I
think it cannot be denied that the working classes, especially
since the peace of 1815, have shown a remarkable talent for
organisation, and a power of discipline and combination inferior
to none.</em> The same, I believe, cannot be said of the middle
classes. With the exception of the Anti-Corn Law League,
I cannot recall at this moment any great successful political
organisation of the middle classes; and living in an age when
everything is known, we now know that that great confederation
... owed its success to a great and unforeseen
calamity, and was on the eve of dispersion and dissolution
only a short time before that terrible event occurred.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
upper and lower classes, he argued, were capable of organisation
and ideas, and the organisation of the latter had been
secret as well as disciplined. Their intelligence and their
discipline, then, were reasons for conferring the franchise, but
their traditional organisation was also a reason for care in its
bestowal, and such discrimination as would not give them a
<em>predominance</em>. “... What has been ... the object of our
legislative labours for many years, but to put an end to a
class-legislation which was much complained of? But you
are now proposing to establish a class legislation of a kind
which may well be viewed with apprehension....”</p>

<p>Disraeli discerned that what in England is discontent, on
the Continent is disaffection; and that revolution abroad
corresponds to reform at home. Chartism verged perilously
on the uprisings which endanger countries where government
is out of touch with the governed. It was a sign that institutions
might be on their trial, and it demanded that those
institutions should resume reality, and win once more the
affections of the people.</p>

<p>In his resolve to spread the franchise in his own manner,
and to neutralise the revolutionary bias of agitators and
secret societies, he never lost sight of the growing force of
public opinion. He himself was “a gentleman of the press;”
in the improved and multiplied newspapers he hailed the
great safety-valve afforded to England by that “publicity”
on which “the great fabric of political freedom” has been
reared. “Free intercourse,” he exclaimed in the ’thirties, “is
the spirit of the age!” So late as 1872, he observed, “... That
has been the principle of the whole of our policy. First of
all, we made our courts of law public, and during the last
forty years we have completely emancipated the periodical
press of England, which was not literally free before, giving
it such power that it throws light upon the life of almost
every class in this country, and I might say upon the life of
almost every individual.” In the press (the light of which
he perhaps valued more than the warmth), he welcomed an
antidote against hidden and perilous associations; and
believed that if the self-respecting hand-labourer received the
vote (as he was entitled to do), he would exercise it in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
cause of freedom, of loyalty, and of order. In 1862, he
declared “parliamentary discipline founded on its only sure
basis, sympathising public opinion,” to be the watchword of
his propaganda. The passage summarises much that I have
discussed.</p>

<p>“... To build up a community, not upon Liberal opinions,
which any man may fashion to his fancy, but upon popular
principles which assert equal rights, civil and religious; to uphold
the institutions of the country because they are the embodiment
of the wants and wishes of the nation, and protect
us alike from individual tyranny and popular outrage; equally
to resist democracy” (as a form of government) “and oligarchy,
and to favour that principle of <em>free aristocracy</em> which is the
only basis and security for constitutional government; ...
to favour popular education, because it is the best guarantee
of public order; to defend local government, and to be as
jealous of the rights of the working man as of the prerogative
of the Crown and the privileges of the senate;—these were
once the principles which regulated Tory statesmen (<i>i.e.</i>
Bolingbroke and Wyndham), and I for one have no wish
that the Tory party should ever be in power unless they
practise them.”</p>

<p>In his great speech during the summer of the following year
on “popular principles” and “liberal opinions,” as well as on
the introduction of his actual Reform Bill, he gave expression
once more to his distinction between “popular privileges” and
“democratic <span class="locked">rights”—</span></p>

<p>“... If the measure bears some reference to the existing
classes in this country, why should we conceal from ourselves
that <em>this country is a country of classes, and a country of classes
it will ever remain</em>? What we desire to do is to give every
one who is worthy of it a fair share in the government of the
country by means of the elective franchise; but at the same
time we have been equally anxious to maintain the character
of the House....”</p>

<p>As a matter of tactics, Disraeli had of design framed the
bill on lines stricter than he was prepared to concede. He
desired that the re-settlement should be enduring, and he
deliberately appealed to the co-operation of both parties for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
this purpose. He had “leaped in the dark,” he had “shot
Niagara.” The storm of obloquy, desertion, and censure broke
over his head, but he was unmoved, because his proposals
were based on principles long held and patiently matured.
Of the lodger franchise he had long ago been the “father.” An
unmitigated household franchise he refused as too “democratic.”
The “direct taxation” franchise and the “dual vote,”
which were intended as barriers for the middle classes, he
surrendered. That educational franchise which was bound up
with a cause that from boyhood had been dear to him; that
“savings-bank” franchise which established the right of
industrial thrift to representation, he was forced to abandon,
by the clamour of the very party that desired education without
religion, and labour as the mere instrument of capital.
Looking back impartially, these derided “fancy franchises”
seem to me a deplorable loss, and even now it would be well
to recognise that the mind and the character should have
representative faculties wholly apart from the power of property.
Disraeli was forced to cast them overboard that he
might preserve the vessel itself during the party hurricane.
But the essential qualifications of residence and rateability he
maintained in the teeth of Mr. Gladstone, and under all the
modifications of the principle which ensued. His mind was
fixed to steer between the extremes alike of those who, under
the mask of emancipation, purposed the despotism of a single
class, and of those who desired to form the government of
this country by the caprice of an irresponsible, an unintelligent,
and an indiscriminate multitude. And he proved his
earnest sincerity by the appeal which closed his speech on the
second reading: “<em>Pass the bill, and then change the ministry
if you like</em>.”</p>

<p>It is not within my province to track the maze of altercations
which attended every step of a bill on which Disraeli,
contrary to his wont, spoke more than three hundred times,
or to raise the dust of controversy this year revived. But,
were it so, I could prove how faithful Disraeli remained
to the central ideas which had animated him from his youth.
So far from having passed a “liberal” measure, he had passed
under colossal difficulties, that for which he had long striven,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
and in a manner which remedied the defects of 1832 without
endangering the repose of the State. Indeed, for the second
time he actually re-created the Conservative party, and, to the
surprise of some of his friends and all his enemies, discovered
in the unknown region of the toilers, with whom he had ever
sympathised, whom he had always trusted, but whom the
Whigs had driven to revolt, and to whom the “cheapest
market” Radicals perpetually begrudged protection, health,
and alleviation—discovered, I say, in these elements—the
pawns of ignoble partisanship—his truest props of order and
of allegiance. The measure and the events of 1884 were to
prove the rightness alike of his confidence and of his caution.
The counties with a lowered franchise became a prey to
agitators. The towns remained staunch and steadfast. And
this, though in 1867 Mr. Bright had sneered at Disraeli for
having “lugged” his “omnibus” of stupid squires up the
hill of democracy.</p>

<p>In his speech of 1859, Disraeli protested against any “predominance
of household democracy.” He kept his word.
Speaking at Edinburgh in the autumn of 1867, he remarked
on this very <span class="locked">topic—</span></p>

<p>“... It may be said you have established a democratic
government in England, because you have established household
suffrage, and you have gone much further than the
measures which you previously opposed.... Now, I am not
at all prepared to admit that household suffrage with the
constitutional conditions upon which we have established it—namely,
residence and rating—has established a democratic
government. But it is unnecessary to enter into that
consideration, because we have not established household
suffrage in England. There are, I think I may say, probably
four million houses in England. Under our ancient laws, and
under the Act of Lord Grey, about one million of those
householders possessed the franchise. Under the Act of
1867, something more than half a million will be added to
that million. Well, then, I want to know if there are four
million householders, and one and a half million in round
numbers possess the suffrage, how can ‘household suffrage’
be said to be established in England?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Thus the proper balance of power, which the bill of 1832
impaired by the exclusion of labour and the enfeeblement of
aristocracy, was restored. The people were at last reconciled
to their leaders. It had been by accident that the Whigs
found themselves arbiters of the national fate in 1832, and it
may be conceded that, according to their lights, they honestly
did their best. To Lord Grey and his colleagues Disraeli
was always just and respectful. But the breach then made
demanded the amends which Disraeli had meditated for years.
By cancelling qualifications arbitrary and irrational, by conferring
political power only in conjunction with social and political
responsibility, by regarding society more than the state, and
influence than interest, by persistent courage and purpose, this
great project succeeded and has endured. The day may come
in the process of generations when, as Disraeli has imagined
elsewhere, industry may cease to repose upon industrialism
alone, and representation may also cease to seem the sole
machinery of politics; when enlightenment and public opinion
may form a real national conscience; and when leadership
may prove itself independent of artificial forms. But till that
day arrives, it will be madness in England to give each citizen,
irrespective of any qualification but existence, a voice in
the Legislature, or entrust them with the sway of an
empire. His avowed aim and his accomplished triumph
were “to restore those rights which were lost in 1832 to the
labouring class of the country,” and to “bring back again that
fair partition of political power which the old Constitution of
the country recognised.” A year after its enactment, in his
great Irish speech he spoke of it as “a most beneficent and
noble Act,” and he added that he looked “with no apprehension
whatever to the appeal that will be made to the people
under the provisions of the Act. I believe you will have a
Parliament full of patriotic and national sentiment, whose
decisions will add spirit to the community and strength to the
State.” “Time,” which was “Contarini Fleming’s” record in
the book of “Adam Besso,” has proved the fulness of his
foresight and the skill of the adjustment.</p>

<p>The mistrust of this great measure at the time, even by
men of intelligence, may be justified by the objection that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
in the distant future Labour may resume its war against
authority in its coming conflict with Capital; and that a rigid
conservatism of defiance is preferable to an adaptive conservatism
of development. But whenever that hour strikes, it
will be seen that Disraeli’s statesmanship has prevented the
revolution which a conservatism of defiance must have prepared
and entailed. Disraeli will have helped to preserve the
English immunity from the violences which mark such
upheavals elsewhere. He sought with all his might to
quicken Capital into duty, and to hearten Labour by conferring
privilege, not as a sop, but as a reward, while, by
alleviating misery through creative enactments, he has conservatised
Labour and kept it in touch with the national
scheme.</p>

<p>It may not, perhaps, have been wholly realised how
harmonious Disraeli’s utterances respecting the progressive
principles of representation in England have been. That is
my excuse for treating the subject with insistence, though by
no means with completeness. To have done so would risk
the exhaustion of the reader as well as of the subject.
Disraeli prevented the raid of alien and disruptive democracy
from making England a home. Out of the common he
extracted the choice. He revived the democracy long
inherent in the English Constitution; he naturalised the
democratic idea on the soil of tradition and order; and
thereby he cemented the solidarity of the State and the
welfare of the nation. He proved that “progress” is not
synonymous with push, and that in going forward it is wise
also to look back, lest the goal should be a precipice. Still,
long as this disquisition has necessarily been, I may hope
that it is not dull, since, in Mrs. Malaprop’s aphorism, “I
don’t think there is a superstitious article in it.”</p>

<span class="subhead">LABOUR—“YOUNG ENGLAND”—“FREE
TRADE”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, Disraeli mocks at the attitude of the early
political economists towards Labour in the person of
“Mr. Toad,” who defined it as “that exertion of mind or
body which is not the involuntary effect of the influence
of natural sensations.” In the second of his long series of
election addresses, he promised to “withhold his support
from every ministry which will not originate some great
measure to ameliorate the condition of the lower orders, ...
to liberate our shackled industry....” The subject is closely
allied to much already surveyed. Here, however, I shall for
the most part leave politics alone, and confine myself mainly
to the social aspects of the question, for from this standpoint
he himself approached it. On Mr. Villiers’ resolutions in
1852, he distinctly stated that he and his friends had opposed
the repeal of the Corn Laws on the main ground that it
would “prove injurious to the interests of Labour;” on the
subsidiary ground that it would injure “considerable interests
in the country.” He had, two years before, urged that it
“was a question of labour, or it was nothing.” Even in the
<cite>Revolutionary Epick</cite>, fifteen years earlier, he had sung, “The
many labour, and the few enjoy.”</p>

<p>The extracts given in the preceding chapter from Disraeli’s
speech on Mr. Hume’s motion in 1848, illustrate the central
ideas which he enforced with singular pertinacity in all his
published works and public utterances.</p>

<p>They are mainly these.</p>

<p>It was an age of emancipation, and Peel liberated commerce.
In so doing he disjointed Labour. His two great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
reforms—that of the Tariff and that of the Corn Laws—designed
as inter-remedial, were certainly calculated
to disturb and dislocate Labour, the one by unloosing
the full forces of straining competition; the other by
revolutionising the centres of industry, by transferring
population from the country to the city, by impairing the
landed interests, both high and low, by shifting the distribution
of toil. At the very moment before his relaxation of
the Corn Laws, Peel, conscious that he would disorganise
Labour,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> had been unconsciously converted to the “right to
physical happiness” system of Manchester—the dryest embodiment
of the theory of the French “physical” equalitarians,
on which I touched in my last chapter. His economics of
“cheapness,” the results of which he feared in relation to the
distribution of employment, thus became associated with a
principle that, as I have shown, demands “unlimited employment
of labour.” He freed Commerce, but he unsettled
Labour, already rebelling against the harsh workings of the
new Poor Laws. Disraeli asked himself if reduced tariffs
would augment purchasing power, if dethroned land would be
succeeded by any novel power for alleviating the Labour thus
unhinged. And, further, he asked whether the middle
class of 1846 would not reap the benefit without bearing the
burden, just as it had done in the Reform of 1832. What
would be the effect of discontent on the institutions of the
country? The two great problems during the whole decade
of 1830–40, when there had occurred a real renaissance,
an awakening, had been Democracy and the Church. Was
Democracy to be detached from the order and orders of
the State? was it to be an anti-national solvent? And was
the Church to realise its mission as a society of believers
instead of being perverted into a library of assent? So far
Chartism and Apostasy had been the answers. Were Sir
Robert Peel’s arithmetical measures, excellent as they were in
theory, any practical power for regeneration? Chartism’s inner
causes had been both the want of employment and the despair
of the employed. In 1840, he proclaimed, to his leader’s
dismay, his deep sympathy, not with Chartism, “but with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Chartists,” preyed on by ambitious leaders, and victimised by
official indifference. Throughout he regarded the whole
“condition of England” question from its moral and social
standpoints—to which economics should be subordinate—as
touching Labour at one end and Leadership at the other.</p>

<p>The claims of Labour, he says, are paramount as those of
property. Property and Labour should be allies, and not
foes; nay, Labour is itself the property of the poor, out of
which the property of the rich is accumulated. The gentlemen
of England should form the advanced guard of Labour;
and, moreover, the master-workmen themselves compose “a
powerful aristocracy.” So long as property was allied both to
land and manufacture, a feeling of public spirit and public
duty in the main characterised the large employers. But a
financial oligarchy was bound to arise, and has arisen, linked
by no visible ties to the workers, and generous more by
gifts of “ransom” than by personal participation; a system
of commerce, too, without leaders, which now works in groups
and merely on “cheapest market” principles, has sprung into
being. And, moreover, the vast multiplication of machines
tended all along, and tends more and more with the huge
increase of intercommunication, to exalt mechanism into
life and to degrade the labourer into a machine, himself
devoid alike of powers and of duties. Over and over again
Disraeli championed, not only the employment of the people,
but variety in their employments. He is never wearied
of scathing any system which might enhance the grinding
monotony of mechanical toil. And all this, while the clamour
for material enjoyment rises higher hour by hour; and the
labourer is driven, in his hard quest after squalid enjoyments,
more into the dark corners of organisations for
coercing a State expected to pauperise him, than to philanthropists
eager to raise his condition by preaching over his
head, before the roof that covers it is decent.</p>

<p>To combat the latter evils—among others—Disraeli
started the “Young England Movement,” and afterwards
protested that the old system of trade reciprocity, with tariffs
as levers, had proved a better guarantee for <em>social</em> happiness
than the retail wealth system of “free imports.” At the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
time, as I shall notice, after the repeal of the Corn Laws
had cheapened commodities, he was decidedly of opinion that
to go back would be too violent an upheaval, unless sanctioned
by the deliberate voice of an instructed nation under
absolutely new conditions. To forestall the dangers of
financial and commercial plutocracy,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> he planned and supported
the many alleviative measures with which his name
and Lord Shaftesbury’s are connected, in the teeth, be it remembered,
of the Radical and Utilitarian opposition; while he
proclaimed in the ’seventies, as he had before proclaimed
in the ’fifties, his programme of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sanitas sanitatum</i>—Health
before Wealth. He foresaw, too, the overcrowding of huge
cities through the waste of the soil, with all its attendant
miseries; even so early as 1846 he had urged that
“nothing is so expensive as a vicious population;” and he felt,
also, that if life without toil is “a sorry sort of lot,” toil
without life is an infinitely worse one. Above all, he looked
in this matter, as throughout, far more to the regeneration of
society than to State interference, so easily evaded and so
devitalising. And he lamented the colossal enlargement of
the towns, which isolates while it excites.</p>

<p>“... In cities,” he protests in <cite>Sybil</cite>, “that condition is
aggravated. A density of population implies a severer
struggle for existence, and a consequent repulsion of elements
brought into too close contact. In great cities men are
brought together by the desire of gain. They are not in a
state of co-operation, but of isolation, as to the making of
fortunes; and for all the rest, they are careless of neighbours.
Christianity teaches us to love our neighbours as ourself;
modern society acknowledges no neighbour.” But he
descried already a rift in the gloom. “Society, still in its
infancy, is beginning to feel its way.”</p>

<p>The late ’thirties and early ’forties, with their agitations
against middle-class apathy and aristocratic neglect,
witnessed to the reality of the disease which was known as
the “condition-of-England question.” Many of the nobles
were not noble; never had been “so many gentlemen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and so little gentleness.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> Exclusion from the suffrage
prevented the natural representation of injuries, and compelled
Labour to band itself covertly, and often under
leaders embittered and embittering with personal and clashing
ambitions. The Reform Act, contended Disraeli, had
not reposed the government in abler hands, nor elevated the
head or enlarged the heart of Parliament. “... On the
contrary, one House of Parliament” (he is writing in 1845)
“has been irremediably degraded into the decaying position
of a mere court of registry, possessing great privileges, on
condition that it never exercises them; while the other
Chamber, that at the first blush and to the superficial
exhibits symptoms of almost unnatural vitality, ... assumes
on a more studious inspection somewhat of the character of
a select vestry fulfilling municipal rather than imperial
offices, and beleaguered by critical and clamorous millions who
cannot comprehend why a privileged and exclusive senate is
requisite to perform functions which immediately concern
<em>all</em>....”</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Labour is far better situated in 1904
than it was in 1844, and undoubtedly this improvement is
partly due to Disraeli’s influence and action. The ideals of
“Young England” have borne fruit. Our “Toynbee Halls”
and university settlements, the recognition of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">noblesse oblige</i>,
the trained public opinion that superior light and leading
are in duty bound to lead and enlighten as well as help
the poor; that the poor are their <em>tenants</em>; <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<span class="i0">The gift without the giver is bare;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">—these and their tone are its outcome. His policies of
health and humanisation, of wholesome housing before technical
teaching, for first emancipating Labour from carking
cares and then entrusting it with public duties, have prospered.
Chartism and its allied mutinies have subsided into
citizenship. The artisans of to-day are princes in comparison
with what they were. The contracted sloth of the utilitarian
middle class has been shaken to follow what emanated from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the universities. In his Guildhall speeches of 1874 and 1875
Disraeli could point with pride to Capital at one with Labour,
and to operatives in sympathy with privileges which they
shared. At this moment they are catered as well as cared
for; and yet their independence is far completer than when
it was aggressive because it was cowed.</p>

<p>But none the less, the fatal overcrowding which he
foresaw, the self-divestment by Mammon of direct and immediate
responsibilities, has produced a fresh class of the
“sweated” and rookeried masses, multiplying the unemployed
and—what is worse—the unemployable in compound ratio,
and still menacing the physique of the nation. The
pressure of poverty is ever with us; of its wretchedness
research has indeed called forth a science. As what we deemed
the lowest ascends, a fresh depth of distress is always bared
to our shame. The democratisation of local government
through the county councils has indeed done much, and will
do more, for the proletariate; but their lack, with notable
exceptions, of high leadership, their tendency to municipal
centralisation, their careless and inexperienced prodigality
with the public purse, their bias towards pauperisation,
their tendency to promote the feverish political ambitions
of a class, and sometimes to confuse the cause of industry
with that of its captains, remain a danger, though, I believe,
a vanishing danger, to the State.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Disraeli’s earliest novel—one of the books “written by
boys,” vague in its restlessness and untamed in its dazzling
extravagance, contains in its episode of “Poor John Conyers”
the germ of that genuine sympathy with Labour which he
afterwards more seriously developed. Apart from his human
instincts and from his desire for a real national unity, it was
founded on his contempt for the merely mechanical or formal in
society; and in 1845, on that tour of experience in Lancashire
which brought home to him anew the terrible gulf between
“the two nations” of rich and poor, and which the pathos, the
humour, the wit and the thought of <cite>Sybil</cite> have immortalised.</p>

<p>Few that have read <cite>Coningsby</cite> will forget the vivid impressions
of Manchester machinery in its pages. They are,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
perhaps, too familiar for quotation, and I prefer here to cite
some sentences from <cite>Sybil</cite>.</p>

<p>“... Twelve hours of daily labour at the rate of one
penny each hour; and even this labour is mortgaged,” groans
the loom-worker. “... Then why am I here?... It is
that the capitalist has found a slave that has supplanted the
labour and ingenuity of man. Once he was an artisan; at
the best he only now watches machines; and even that occupation
slips from his grasp to the woman and the child. The
capitalist flourishes, he amasses wealth; we sink, lower and
lower; lower than the beasts of burthen; for they are fed
better than we are, cared for more. And it is just, for
according to the present system they are more precious.
And yet they tell us that the interests of Capital and of
Labour are identical. <em>If a society that has been created by
labour suddenly becomes independent of it, that society is bound
to maintain the race whose only property is labour, out of the
proceeds of that other property which has not ceased to be productive.</em>...
We sink among no sighs except our own. And
if they give us sympathy—what then? Sympathy is the
solace of the Poor; but for the Rich there is Compensation.</p>

<p>“You (the nobles) govern us still with absolute authority,
and you govern the most miserable people on the face of the
globe. ‘And is this a fair description of the people of
England?’ said Lord Valentine. ‘A flash of rhetoric, I presume,
that would place them lower than ... the serfs of
Russia or the lazzaroni of Naples.’</p>

<p>“‘Infinitely lower,’ said the delegate, ‘for they are not
only degraded, but conscious of their degradation. <em>They no
longer believe in any difference between the governing and the
governed classes of this country.</em> They are sufficiently enlightened
to feel they are victims. Compared with the
privileged of their own land, they are in a lower state than
any other population compared with its privileged classes.’</p>

<p>“‘The people must have leaders,’ said Lord Valentine.</p>

<p>“‘And they have found them,’ said the delegate.</p>

<p>“‘When it comes to a push, they will follow their
nobility,’ said Lord Valentine.</p>

<p>“‘Will their nobility lead them?’ said the other delegate....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
“‘We have an aristocracy of wealth,’ said the delegate
who had chiefly spoken. ‘In a progressive civilisation wealth
is the only means of class distinction; but a new disposition
of wealth may remove even this.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah! You want to get at our estates,’ said Lord
Valentine, smiling, ‘but the effort on your part may resolve
society into its original elements, and the old sources of distinction
may again develop themselves.’</p>

<p>“‘Tall barons will not stand against Paixhans’ rockets,’
said the delegate. ‘Modern science has vindicated the
natural equality of man.’</p>

<p>“‘And I must say I am very sorry for it,’ said the other
delegate; ‘for human strength always seems to me the natural
process of settling affairs.’”</p>

<p>To cherish national unison as a higher form of human
harmony than the discordant bond of automatic groups; to
force the governing to sympathise with the governed; to
establish that “Labour requires regulation as much as Property;”
to raise, train, improve and establish labour “rather,”
as he wrote in 1870, “by the use of ancient forms and the
restoration of the past than by political revolutions founded
on abstract ideas,” were Disraeli’s aims. In all except the
important one of the last, the means for accomplishing them,
Carlyle’s message is the same. There is a passage in <cite>Coningsby</cite>
where Disraeli dreams that a day may come when
industry will cease to obey mere industrialism. There is
another in Carlyle’s “Past and Present”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> to the same
effect. For both, the nobility of labour was a central
idea; for both, the conviction that the cavaliers of England
should prove its captains; for both, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sanitas sanitatum</i> was a
practical ideal. “Deliver me,” cries Carlyle, “these rickety
perishing souls of infants, and let your cotton trade take its
chance.” Disraeli and Carlyle alike abominated the doctrine
that national happiness consists merely in material wealth.
A shared or common wealth of endeavour and influence was
a goal for each; for each, too, the main problem remained,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
“<em>How, in conjunction with inevitable democracy, indispensable
sovereignty is to exist.</em>”</p>

<p>“... If there be a change,” said Sybil, “it is because in
some degree the People have learnt their strength.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Dismiss from your mind those fallacious fancies,”
said Egremont. “The People are not strong; the People
never can be strong. Their attempts at self-vindication will
end only in their suffering and confusion. It is civilisation
that has effected, that is effecting, this change. It is that
increased knowledge of themselves that teaches the educated
their social duties. <em>There is a day-spring in the history of
this nation which perhaps those only who are on the mountaintops
can as yet recognise. You deem you are in darkness, and
I see a dawn.</em> The new generation of the aristocracy of
England are not tyrants, not oppressors, Sybil....
Their intelligence, better than that, their hearts, are open
to the responsibility of their situation. But the work
that lies before them is no holiday work. It is not the
fever of superficial impulse that can remove the deep-fixed
barriers of centuries of ignorance and crime. Enough that
their sympathies are awakened; time and thought will bring
the rest. They are the natural leaders of the People,
Sybil....”</p>

<p>I may be permitted to point out a likeness and a contrast.
The seething ferment on the Continent was pricking Labour
into an insurgent materialism which, in the dearth of ancient
and active institutions fraught with the balm of healing,
leagued itself to attack all forms of authority, kingship and
capital alike.</p>

<p>“Ah, the People, this poor King in tatters,” wrote Heine
from Paris in 1848, “has fallen on flatterers far more shameless,
as they swing their censers around his head, than the
courtiers of Byzantium or Versailles. These court lackeys of
the People incessantly vaunt its virtues and excellences,
crying aloud: ‘How beautiful is the People! how good is the
People! how intelligent is the People!’ No, you lie. The
People is not beautiful; on the contrary, it is very ugly.
But its ugliness is due to its dirt, and will vanish with public
baths for the free ablutions of his Majesty. A piece of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
soap, too, will do no harm; and we shall then see a People
in the beauty of cleanliness—a washen People. The People
whose goodness is thus magnified is not good at all. It is
often as bad as other potentates. But its baseness flows
from hunger. When once it has well eaten and drunk, it
will smile, gracious and well-favoured as the rest. Nor is
his Majesty over-intelligent. He is possibly stupider than
the others—stupid with the bestiality of his minions; he
will only love or heed the speakers, or howlers, of the jargon
of his passions: he hates every brave soul that converses in
the speech of reason, and that would ennoble and enlighten
him.”</p>

<p>Heine was leading “Young Germany.” A few years
earlier, Disraeli was leading “Young England.” The contrast
between the atmosphere of the two countries deserves a
passing comment. “Young England” aimed at betterment
in that very feudal spirit which the poet—the “unfrocked
Romantic”—by turns breathed and spurned. In Germany
the weird medley of the “Romantic School” had for fifty
years been striving to rewaken the myths, the chivalry, the
wistfulness of the past. But its direct influences were merely
æsthetic, and mainly sentimental; while they eventually
became actually anæmic—a vague reverie of mediæval moonlight
and pallid ghosts. The uprooting French Revolution
had swept away both castle and cobwebs, and in Germany
the “folk-song” was the sole antiquity to which this Romantic
attachment could cling, and by which it could touch the
patriotism of a disunited people. But in England, Scott’s
“buff-jerkin” revival, at which Carlyle so unjustly scoffed,
was more than a literary sport; it had already braced the
nation with the fresh breeze of an invigorating tradition. It
brought back and home the inheritance of a real throne and
a real nobility, of chivalry, of daring, and of prowess; it
reminded the people that the humblest was once protected by
the highest; and though it perhaps burked or omitted much
that disgraced the age of the tournament, the foray, and the
cloister, it quickened its best, its most hopeful and most
cheerful elements. It took the dry bones from their mouldering
tomb and put the breath of life, the wholesome laughter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
of humour, and the brightness of beauty into and about their
scattered fragments; whereas in Germany the Romantics
rather embalmed and buried the living energies of the present
in a Gothic mausoleum, weird with wan emblems, and chill
and solemn as a cathedral vault.</p>

<p>Disraeli recognised that our country thrives by adaptation
and adjustment; that it is the region of natural growth, and
not of sudden blossom; of the oak, not the aloe. In inter-dependence,
even more than independence, in the mutual
ties of classes, Disraeli discerned the English root for democratic
ideas which had all along lurked in the soil. England
is great because of that same insular inaccessibility to ideas
which repelled Heine. Her slowness of insight vanishes
gradually, and not by leaps and bounds—through growth and
conduct rather than through universal theories. An idea
knocks at our gates for generations before it wins admittance;
but when it once enters, it becomes naturalised and ceases to
be alien; it becomes actualised; it dwells and walks and votes,
and has commerce at large. It becomes part of the popular
life and parcel of the national behaviour.</p>

<p>“Young England” prepared the ground for social regeneration.
It sought to raise the conditions of labour. It was
no rose-water club, but, short-lived as it proved, was a real
forerunner of measures. A word, therefore, upon it may be
pardoned in this connection. Many in the past century have
played the part of “saviours of society.” Robert Owen,
Ferdinand Lassalle, Napoleon III., Karl Marx, and the
eccentric Mr. Urquhart, who furnished some of the <em>traits</em> for
Disraeli’s “Sidonia.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> But none in this country have been at
once so genuine and effective as this association of “Young
England;” for, enlisting the enthusiasm of the high and the
young, it struck into the roots of national character, without
which no development is feasible. Young England aimed
further, at rendering leadership sympathetic with labour. It
wanted to revive in the lowly a sense of privilege, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
noble to quicken higher standards of obligation; it wished
to recall the heroic; and this it tried to accomplish, not by
social disturbance, but by seeking to arouse ancient ideals
still slumbering in national traditions. For this purpose it
appealed to youth—“the trustees of posterity;”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> to the
power of personal influence and example; and above all,
it hoped, as I have already noticed, to counteract the
soullessness of utilitarianism.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!” (Disraeli makes Gerard observe in <cite>Sybil</cite>); “I
know that style of speculation.... Your gentlemen who
remind you that a working man now has a pair of cotton
stockings, and that Harry the Eighth was not so well off. At
any rate, the condition of classes must be judged of by the
age and by their relations with each other.”</p>

<p>It was also a vigorous protest against that retort of the
Liberal on the Radical—the sluggish doctrine of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez-faire</i>,
the principle of “stew-in-your-own-juice,” “devil take the
hindmost,” “muddling through,” and “let <em>ill</em> alone.” Disraeli
had combated it from the <span class="locked">first:—</span></p>

<p>“In Vraibleusia” (I quote from his early satire of <cite>Popanilla</cite>)
“we have so much to do that we have no time to think—a
habit which only becomes nations who are not employed.
You are now fast approaching the great shell question; a
question which, I confess, affects the interest of every man in
this island more than any other.... No one, however, can
deny that the system works well; and if anything at any time
go wrong, why, really Mr. Secretary Periwinkle is a wonderful
man, and our most eminent conchologist—he no doubt will
set it right; and if by any chance things are past even his
management, why, then, I suppose, to use our national motto,
<em>something will turn up</em>.”</p>

<p>It further served as antidote to the self-complacence and
retail outlook of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>. The “Middle-Middles,”
healthfully and powerfully as they symbolise decency, order,
and common sense, too often lack, even in their educated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
varieties, perception and sympathy. At present they pervade
Parliament, while the Press—which since 1867 appeals more
and more to the gallery—controls opinion. Hence the dearth
of accord between the prate of Parliament and a nation that
realises its unity. Hence springs the momentary decay of
Parliament itself—not from party spirit, but from the inanition
of parties representing principles, without which party sinks
into faction.</p>

<p>Of the anti-middle class attitude of “Young England,” a
notable instance occurs in “Angela Pisani,” the brilliant fiction
of George Smythe, afterwards seventh Lord Strangford (in
Disraeli’s words), “a man of brilliant gifts; of dazzling wit,
infinite culture and fascinating manners,” who “could promulgate
a new faith with graceful enthusiasm.” The tirade is
placed on the lips of Napoleon, denouncing the “puddle-blooded”
whom he had “made great men, but could not make
gentlemen,” and its reproaches—certainly not characteristic of
Disraeli—apply, of course, in an infinitely less degree to
England.</p>

<p>The nucleus of “Young England” had begun in a close
association of university friends. The Cambridge “Apostles”
comprised Tennyson and Hallam, Monteith and Doyle, and
“Cool-of-the-evening” Monckton-Milnes. Disraeli, Lord
Strangford, and Lord John Manners reinforced this nucleus
with Faber, Hope, Baillie Cochrane (afterwards Lord Lamington),
and others; they gave them an ampler scope and a
longer view, but not without murmuring jealousies. They
taught that the spirit of reform transcended its letter, and
that the English “romantic school”—just as later on the
English pre-Raphaelites in Art—must reseek the fountainhead
of original principles. Milnes wrote in 1844: “You
must have been amused at the name of ‘Young England,’
which we started so long ago, being usurped by opinions
so different and so inferior a tone of thought. It is, however,
a good phenomenon in its way, and one of its products—Lord
John Manners—a very fine, promising fellow.
The worst of them is that they are going about the
country talking education and liberality, and getting
immense honour for the very things for which the Radicals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
have been called all possible blackguards and atheists a few
years ago.”</p>

<p>The newer Radical reforms, however, were based on “the
greatest happiness” principle of utility; whereas the league
of “Young England” was founded on the expansion of
traditions, and more especially on the immemorial rights of
Labour. What “Young England” really effected was to infuse
enthusiasm into institutions. In 1838 this same “Mr. Vavasour”
of <cite>Tancred</cite>, and “Mr. Tremaine Bertie” of <cite>Endymion</cite>,
had also written: “We have set agoing a new dining club
which promises well. Twenty of the most charming men in
the universe met last Tuesday. They won’t call it ‘Young
England,’ however.” It is no disrespect to the memory of
the late Lord Houghton to say that the vague eclecticism of
his youth scarcely fostered a robust energy or a keen insight.
His “remarks” on <cite>Coningsby</cite> in <cite>Hood’s Magazine</cite> under the
name of “Real England” were a sympathetic commentary;
but, a born <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dilettante</i>, he “lionised” ideas as he “lionised”
genius. He patted intuition on the back. He was the Mrs.
Leo Hunter of politics; and he played admirably the part
of “Bennet Langton” to Carlyle’s “Dr. Johnson.” He somewhat
prattled of “silences” and “eternities.” Well does
Disraeli make “Waldershare” in <cite>Endymion</cite> exclaim of him:
“... What I do like in him ... is this revival of the Pythagorean
system, and heading a party of silence. That is rich.”</p>

<p>Lord Lamington—the “Buckhurst” of <cite>Coningsby</cite>—who in
his pleasant glimpse of the movement has supplemented its
muster-roll by the names of Borthwick and Stafford, quotes
Serjeant Murphy’s pasquinade of “Jack Sheppard.” Its last
verse runs as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<i>We have Smythe and Hope with his opera-hat,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But they cannot get Dicky Milnes, that’s flat—</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He is not yet tinctured with Puseyite leavening,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But he may drop in in the ‘cool of the evening.’</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The “Puseyite leavening” recalls the strictures of Carlyle
on the High Church proclivities of a portion of the movement.
Coleridge’s great book on the Church had undoubtedly
stirred both thought and enthusiasm. Disraeli, as I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
show hereafter, wished to make the Church a living social
regenerator of the “national spirit,” to see it at once disciplined
and enthusiastic, to restore its original functions, to
render it really “Anglican;” and in his old age—strenuously
opposed as he ever was to the “mass in masquerade,” firmly
resolved as he remained to uphold orderly Protestantism—he
has outlined at once a portrait and a type of his permanent
meaning in the person of “Nigel Penruddock;” just as he has
drawn a picture of “Young England” Anglicanism in the
“St. Lys” of <cite>Sybil</cite>, the prototype of whom was Faber.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1844, Carlyle thus characteristically
addresses Monckton-Milnes—</p>

<p>“... <em>On the whole, if ‘Young England’ would altogether
fling its shovel-hat into the lumber-room, much more cast its
purple stockings to the nettles, and honestly recognising what was
dead, ... address itself frankly to the magnificent but as yet
chaotic Future, ... telling men at every turn that it knew and
saw for ever clearly the body of the Past to be dead (and even
to be damnable, if it pretended to be still alive and to go about in
a galvanic state), what achievement might not ‘Young England’
manage for us!</em>” Carlyle was ever a free-thinking Puritan, a
creedless Calvinist. “What was dead,” “what pretended
still to be alive,” was the Church of England.... It is easy
to deride that youthful display of poor metre, but fine
enthusiasm, “England’s Trust,” by Lord John Manners.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<i>With Roncesvalles upon his banners</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Comes prancing along my Lord John Manners.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Carlyle misliked in him what he disliked in Scott, the
“properties” of Romanticism. But the earnestness of
Manners’s little volume is beyond question. In the Church
it recognises the national recuperative force and salve for
anarchy. “We laugh at all commandment save our own,”
sighs the boyish <span class="locked">devotee—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<i>Yes, through the Church must come the healing power</i><br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>And Labour had ever been the sacred trust of the Church.
Divorce Labour from religion, and the State falls. It had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
been the fault of the Church herself that Labour had gone
out of history, as it were, and crossed over to a more primitive
form of true religious fervour under the Methodist revival;
but the Church alone, as a national growth, could hope, if
true to its high destinies, for the preservation of the great
mass of the populace from the disruptive elements of unbelief.
The Church, too, was the natural educator of the people.
True, Manners’s Anglicanism was that of Laud; true, also, to
that name he rhymes “adored.” But it is also true that the
whole brotherhood felt that if the Church, and through it the
State, was to be quickened, it must revert, like the State, to
its origin; it must no more be regarded merely as an
endowed official or as a consecrated police, but as a divine
institution. Moreover, Disraeli also regarded the English
Church as the special protectress of popular liberties. I shall
return to this subject in its proper place hereafter; but I
may here add that these convictions of “Young England”
were vehemently advocated by Disraeli in his speeches on the
Irish Church more than twenty years after the “Young
England” brotherhood came to an end.</p>

<p>Disraeli always urged the immense importance of parochial
life as even greater than political. Had the higher classes
understood “the order of the peasantry,” ricks and dwellings
would not have been burned down in the ’thirties. In advocating
the claims of ancient country-side customs, he raised
the plea of humanising ceremony—one certainly cherished by
the upper classes for themselves. The people would not, it
is true, be “fed” by morris revelries, and they starved equally
without them.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that such a cause, with such a
leader, followed by aristocratic youth and attended by the
revival of maypole dances and tournaments, should escape
ridicule and even suspicion. Grey-headed noblemen, who
resented any efforts to render institutions real, and for
whom enthusiasm meant vulgarity, shook their heads over
the follies of their sons, seduced by the wiles of a designing
adventurer. But to such as still doubt Disraeli’s sincerity in
these matters, and refuse to be convinced by a long chain
of after-utterances, I would simply suggest the following fact.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Disraeli’s speech of April 11, 1845, on the Maynooth grant<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
broke up the “Young England” association, and terminated
his leadership of it. What was the main principle of that
speech? It was this: “... You find your Erastian system
crumbling from under your feet.... I have unfaltering
confidence in the stability of our Church, but I think that
the real source of the danger which threatens it is its connection
with the State, which places it under the control of the
House of Commons that is not necessarily of its communion.”
He denied that the State had ever “endowed” the Church.
The Church owned property which was the patrimony of the
poor. He argued that since 1829 the State’s relation to the
Church had altered. He implied, as he often afterwards
asserted, that the union of Church and State was for the
benefit of the State far more than for that of the Church.
Now, this attitude was eminently that of his “Young England”
professions. And yet its fearless expression dissolved
a gathering which his detractors maintained was used merely
as a step to personal advancement.</p>

<p>Carlyle, in the passage above cited, evinced the same
irritable impatience that he exhibited in 1849, when he
cursed parliamentary institutions because a particular Parliament
had over-talked itself. He was an iconoclast who,
however, often confused the symbol with the faith that underlies
it, and in dethroning the image would have dashed the
glamour of its shrine. In 1848—the year of anarchy—Disraeli
made a famous speech (the speech which procured
him his future leadership of the House). He upheld these
institutions while he denounced that very Parliament which
moved Carlyle’s indignation. The future has proved him
right, and the sage wrong. The practical fruits of the future,
too, have vindicated the peculiar tinge that Disraeli himself
lent to the “Young England” brotherhood.</p>

<p>One closing word on the social aims of “Young England.”
I may summarise them by the phrase “Health and Home.”
They compassed the relief of industry, and they implied the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
effort to shame the knights of industry into some chivalry
towards it.</p>

<p>“Pitt,” wisely comments Mr. Kebbel, “ended the quarrel
between the King and the aristocracy, and reconciled the
Whig doctrine of monarchy with the Whig doctrine of Parliament.
Peel accommodated Toryism to the new <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i>
established by the Reform Bill, and his name will always be
identified with the progress of middle-class reform. <em>Lord
Beaconsfield carried Toryism into the next stage, and made it
the business of his life to close up the gap in our social system
which ... had been gradually widening, and to reconcile
the working classes to the Throne, the Church, and the
Aristocracy.</em>”</p>

<p>To those who object that beyond Foreign Policy and the
last Reform Bill, Disraeli effected little that is lasting, this is
the answer. He was prouder of his many social reforms than
of his Berlin Treaty. He was a born conciliator. He put a
new and powerful leaven into the social lump, and he inspired
the generous youth of the country. What he especially sought
to mitigate was irresponsible Plutocracy, with a shifting stock
of vagrant and unrelated Labour bought in the cheapest
market, sold in the dearest; without stability, without ties,
without allegiance.</p>

<p>“‘I am not against Capital’ (he makes “Enoch Craggs”
declaim in <cite>Endymion</cite>), ‘what I am against is Capitalists.’</p>

<p>“‘But if we get rid of capitalists, we shall soon get rid of
capital.’</p>

<p>“‘No, no,’ said Enoch, with his broad accent, shaking his
head and with a laughing eye. ‘Master Thornberry (the
Radical) has been telling you that. He is the most inveterate
capitalist of the whole lot.... Master Thornberry is against
the capitalists in land; but there are other capitalists nearer
home, and I know more about them. I was reading a book
the other day about King Charles—Charles I., whose
head they cut off—I am very liking to that time, and read a
good deal about it; and there was Lord Falkland, a great
gentleman of those days, and he said when Archbishop Laud
was trying on some of his priestly tricks, that “If he were to
have a Pope, he would rather the Pope were at Rome than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Lambeth.” So I sometimes think, if we are to be ruled by
capitalists, I would sooner, perhaps, be ruled by gentlemen of
estate, who have been long among us, than by persons who
build big mills, who come from God knows where, and, when
they have worked their millions out of our flesh and bone, go
God knows where....’”</p>

<p>The two river bills carried at Disraeli’s instigation in
1852; the twenty-nine bills for ameliorating the position of
factory operatives, passed despite those Radicals who predicted
ruin for the manufacturer; the Employers and Workmen
Acts, the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act,
the Poor Law Amendment Act, the Commons Act, the
Artisans’ Dwellings Acts, the Public Health Act, the Rating
Act, the Employers’ Liability Acts, the Agricultural Holdings
Act, among many others, attest the victory of “popular
Toryism” over “class Liberalism,” and the protection of
suffering against selfishness. “Young England,” like all
Utopian propaganda, was a romantic vision, and exceeded
actuality. But in essence it has been eminently practical.
Classes (of which England is made) are infinitely more in
communion than they were in 1840. The effort to set them
by the ears and to oppose the “masses” to the “classes” has
ignominiously failed. The Church of England has roused
itself to the national needs beyond all comparison with those
days. The appeals of <cite>Sybil</cite>, <cite>Coningsby</cite>, and <cite>Tancred</cite>, ridiculed
as rodomontade and branded as a charlatan’s dodge, have
been rendered into action, and stand confessed as the deeply
felt and pondered schemes of a poet and a statesman.
“When,” says Bolingbroke, “great coolness of judgment is
united to great warmth of imagination, we see that happy
combination which we call a genius.” Such has proved
Disraeli, and his inmost soul is embodied in that “Young
England” which he organised and encouraged in a freezing
atmosphere. Over fifty years ago he exhorted youth, at the
Manchester Athenæum, as “the trustees of posterity.” “The
man,” he then said, “who did not look up would look down,
and he who did not aspire was destined perhaps to grovel.”
The youth of to-day is far more conscious of its burden than
was the youth of any class in the ’forties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
It was mainly on these social grounds that Disraeli
resisted that system of free imports which has gone down to
history as “Free Trade.” He never denied that it was calculated
to enrich manufacturers and manufacturing centres; he
grew to admit its benefits to the consumer, although these
were by no means wholly due to its action; but he deprecated
its “economic frenzy.” He held that it injured the
producer<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> and played havoc both with land and distribution
of labour. He thought it would eventually impair morale and
physique, and sacrifice the general welfare to the material
interests of a class; and, before it was nationally adopted, he
considered that all ends would have been better served by
the adoption of that system of reciprocal treaties<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>—on a
principle called by him “at once national and cosmopolitan”—which
was termed “Free Trade” in the days of Pitt,
and had been inaugurated in 1713 by the abortive tariff
of the great Utrecht Treaty; nor will it now be doubted
that if in 1846 a comprehensive scheme of technical education
had been set on foot, many of the evils engendered by
over-competition would have been avoided, whatever fiscal
system this country had chosen.</p>

<p>Writing so early as 1832 to the Wycombe electors, he
even then declared: “... With regard to the Corn Laws, I
will support any change, the basis of which is <em>to relieve the
consumer without injuring the farmer</em>.” This was not the
“Radical” doctrine of those days.</p>

<p>Disraeli has shown conclusively that in English history
such a principle as absolute “protection” never existed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
The original principle up to the time of Anne was to feed
and supply a population then small enough so to be supported
at home, and to encourage the wealth and power of trade.
He has shown that Walpole, in this respect imitating the
rival whom he destroyed, wisely followed this principle in its
colonial applications; though he unwisely divorced productive
trade from the land, and set the moneyed against the landed
classes, the high finance against the country gentlemen, into
whose shoes, however, it soon stepped. He has shown that
when the colonial system broke down by the secession of
our greatest and worst governed colony, Pitt the Second
reverted to the old, the natural principle of exchange with
the continent by tariff. The exigencies of the Revolutionary
and Napoleonic wars forced an interlude; and for a time
England was fed by foreign corn in free competition with
her own—the very time when the loaf was dearest. But
Lord Liverpool recurred to the principle; and Peel up to
1845—when his hand was confessedly forced by the appalling
famine in Ireland—was in favour of the varying duties
termed the sliding scale, as opposed to the fixed duties of
the Whigs and the no-duties of the Radicals. That scale
he eventually surrendered under the impulse of Lord John
Russell’s “Edinburgh Letter,” and was suddenly converted
by the Manchester School. In logic, and apart from
human and national instincts, their theories were as irrefragable
as those of our modern bimetallists, and of those
ancient economists on whose doctrines they rested. But
their lasting usefulness depended on the final achievement
of a cosmopolitan confederation. Disraeli presaged with
weighty reasons, scouted when they were detailed, that other
nations would never fall into the scheme; he analysed the
special conditions of France, Germany, and America. He
also foretold, concerning corn, in common with all articles
of certain and practically unlimited demand (as cotton and
tea, for examples), that “the moment you have a settled
market, in exact proportion to the demand, prices will fall.
This is the inevitable rule.” He pressed further the grave
peril, hardly yet realised, of England’s dependence on foreign
supplies in time of war. But beyond all, he emphasised the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
social dangers—the misery for individuals and for classes.
In this precipitate measure towards a material class-millennium,
he discerned a large element of possible
denationalisation, a displacement of labour which must unavoidably
deluge the unwieldy towns, and which would to
some extent relax the fibre of the nation and weaken its
very means of defence, the replacement of excellence by
cheapness, and of national welfare by wealth, the substitution
for the landed interest which ought to preponderate though
never to predominate, not, as seemed for the moment, by a
high-toned class of responsible manufacturers, but eventually
by an overwhelming clique of irresponsible capitalists
with self-interests fluid as their portable property; the
decrease of the national, the natural sway of large landowners
inheriting a representative sense of accountability to
tenants and dependants; a probably great fall in agriculture
and its profits, prices and wages; the waste on a large scale
and the depopulation of the soil itself; the special aggravation
of ruinous elements in Ireland; an ultimate decay, when
foreign competition should develop, of that very manufacturing
interest the system was protested to advantage and intended
to protect; for he divined already in the ’forties that to fight
hostile tariffs with “free imports” could only benefit England
while continental manufacturers were in comparative infancy.</p>

<p>Most of this in great measure he foresaw, and in all this
has been amply justified. What he did not anticipate was
the enormous stature which these developments have now
reached. Multitudes of telling instances might be given
from those remarkable speeches, the pith and point of which
were always how this change would affect the labouring
classes. I will single out two alone, and both from that
great speech of 1846 on Mr. Miles’s amendment, which, in the
light of the present, reads like a continuous prophecy.
Speaking of the displacement of labour in connection with
the then sparse distribution of the precious metals, which he
pointed out six years later must again modify the situation
owing to the recent and immense discoveries of gold, he said:
“... Every year and in every market English labour will
receive less in return of foreign articles. But gold and silver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
are foreign articles; and in every year and in every
market English labour will have less command of gold and
silver....” “... Supposing you import five millions more
from Russia than you ever did before, how will you make
your payments, if they take no more additional goods from
you than they do now?... I know it will be replied they
manage these things by means of bills and so on. But that
will not improve the case. Suppose ... you buy Russian
bills on Brazil and New York to the amount of those five
millions, and you thus complete your transaction. But you
have already supplied the Americans and the Brazilians with
as much of your goods as you cared to take, and if you
want to sell more to them, you must do so at a great
sacrifice....”</p>

<p>Once more, as regards foreign competition. He forecasted
that of America; and in demolishing the argument
that Prussia’s protective Zollverein was being “shaken;”
he instanced Mecklenburg, induced by English remonstrances
to abstain from joining, but now complaining that: “...
After all the sacrifices we have made, if the Zollverein are
to have free importation to England, we have no advantage
whatever, and the best thing we can now do is to join and ...
advance the cause of native industry.”</p>

<p>Disraeli resolved that if the repeal became law, the burdens
which had been thrown on the land, because of the privileges
which were its ancient trust, should in fairness be mitigated;
that it should compete as freely as other manufacturers, for
he never ceased to object to a distinction, as manufacturers,
between the farmer, the miller, and the mill-owner.</p>

<p>“... I know,” he urged in a speech full of dignity and
wisdom, “that we have been told that ... we shall derive
from this great struggle not merely the repeal of the Corn
Laws, but the transfer of power from one class to another,
to one distinguished for its intelligence and wealth—the
manufacturers of England. My conscience assures me that
I have not been slow in doing justice to the intelligence of
that class; certain I am that I am not one of those who
envy them their wide and deserved prosperity; but I must
confess my deep mortification that in an age of political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
regeneration, when all social evils are ascribed to the operation
of class interests, it should be suggested that we are to
be rescued from the alleged power of one class, only to sink
under the avowed dominion of another;” and he concluded
with the hope that if the monarchy of England, “mitigated
by the acknowledged authority of the estates of the realm,”
was to prove “a worn-out dream,” if England was to sink
“under the thraldom of capital, ... of those who while they
boast of their intelligence are prouder of their wealth,” if a
new force must be summoned to maintain “the immemorial
monarchy of England,” that “novel power” might be found
in “the invigorating energies of an educated and enfranchised
people.”</p>

<p>All this has happened. A thraldom to the middle class
came into being, and was tempered by Disraeli’s own franchise
bill, and by an education act sufficient, though not conceived in
the decentralised form which Disraeli desired, but never won
the opportunity of effecting. And out of this thraldom is
springing that other of plutocracy—one which exercises great
political power without assuming great political duties; one
in the interest of which, it seems to me, some of the new fiscal
changes now being mooted are designed.</p>

<p>These wholesale changes I cannot but feel that Disraeli
would have withstood. Many features in Mr. Chamberlain’s
plan would have enlisted his sympathy, but in their entirety
he would have thought them hazardous. Some protection
for the grazier he might have upheld; he always laid stress
on the importance of home markets. A moderate duty on
corn, in partial, though most inadequate, aid of agriculture,
he might have favoured as a necessary lever for colonial
reciprocity; especially as it would be spread over the untaxed
colonial, the foreign dutiable imports. It would scarcely
much affect the price of bread, and the very Peelites forewent
the fallacy of the dear loaf; although, as in 1852, he
would show that even a four shilling duty on imported corn
could never restore the land to its former footing. “We
ought,” he would again argue, “to go to the country on
principle, and not upon details. We say we think there
should be measures brought forward” (as since have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
brought forward) “to put the cultivators of the soil in a
position to allow them to compete with foreign industry.”
What, however, he then urged with all his force was that the
fiscal revolution had confessedly caused vexatious taxes.
“Sir,” he said in 1852, “I do now and ever shall look on the
changes which took place in 1846, both as regards the repeal
of the Corn Laws and the alteration of the Sugar Duties,
as totally unauthorised. I opposed them ... <em>from an apprehension
of the great suffering which must be incurred by such
a change</em>. That suffering in a great degree, though it may
be limited to particular classes, has in some instances been
even severer than we anticipated. But I deny that at any
time after those laws were passed, either I, or the bulk of
those with whom I have the honour to act, have ever maintained
a recurrence to the same laws that regulated those
industries previously to 1846.” He then showed the difference
between Lord Derby’s proposed “fixed duty” and the
old state of affairs; while he continued: “... When we come
to this question of fixed duty, ... I must say now what I
said before in this House, that I will not pin my political
career on any policy which is not after all a principle, but
a measure. Our wish is, that the interests which we believe
were unjustly treated in 1846,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> should receive the justice
which they deserve, with as little injury to those who may
have benefited more than they were entitled to, as it is
possible for human wisdom to devise. <em>Sir, I call that reconciling
the interests of the consumer and the producer, when you
do not permit the consumer to flourish by placing unjust taxes
upon the producer; while at the same time you resort to no tax
which gives to the producer; an unjust and artificial price for
his production.</em>...”</p>

<p>But any prohibitive tax on foreign manufactures—that is
another matter, one which would protect certain trades at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
expense of the community, and aggravate the very evils which
Free Trade introduced. Such a system must press all the
harder on that class of consumers whose pay would remain
unaffected by its results, and who would, in fact, be subsidising
our colonies out of their emptied pockets. The sentiment of
the colonies he would have prized beyond measure, but
other means for riveting it might be found; and in the
undeveloped condition of many among them, would not a
Canadian favouritism sow a harvest of jealousies? Moreover,
the colonial population as a whole is still far too scanty for
the replacement of our markets abroad; and further, the two
main channels of cheap capital and British prosperity—our
carrying trade and London’s commercial position as the clearing-house
of the world—might be revolutionised by changes,
to which no limit could be fixed. And again, the remission
of Income Tax ought in justice to accompany such a system,
for that tax was revived by Peel expressly because the
revenue had to be reimbursed for its losses on adopting the
measures for free imports. With respect to “dumping,”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> its
conditions contain its cure. England, no longer the main
workshop of the world, cannot perhaps be so generous as
heretofore, but she can still afford to be generous. As for
the promise of higher wages through protective duties, wages
are more likely to rise through the resumption of gold imports
from South Africa; while the joint result of retaliatory tariffs
and such imports would be doubly to enhance the price of
commodities for the mass. On the other hand, the vision of
a self-supporting empire he would honour, and equally the
sincere and commanding zeal of its prophet. But he would
surely argue that the times were far from ripe, and that
small and gradual beginnings might lay firmer foundations
than a colossal combination of incompatibles. Again, he
would, as the writer fancies, deplore a loud and unsolicited
appeal to the passions of a multitude and the greed of a class
easily thus led into a lordship of mob despotism. At the
same time, he would certainly recognise, as Mr. Chamberlain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
alone has fully recognised, the crying need for a better distribution
of employment.</p>

<p>Disraeli over and over again affirmed that since the nation
had endorsed this vital change, its reversal was impracticable
unless the considered national demand for it became
overwhelming. It was one of his cardinal ideas that without
such deliberate demand no great change of national policy
should be risked in any department. In 1852, he and
Lord Derby appealed to the country on a modified issue of
this question—that of a fixed duty. The country’s answer
Disraeli considered as final, even in that regard; nor, so far
as he was able, would he ever permit these momentous issues
to be reopened by any party or section. He remained
devoted to the reciprocity principle. He believed that “give
and take” is the foundation of trade which is barter. But,
though he descried rocks ahead in the future, he recognised
that the consumer had benefited by the free opening of our
ports, that so far as material wealth was concerned, England
had become the emporium and the banker of the world. On
the other hand, this very prosperity had aggravated the
misery of a class and had raised those problems which are
still engaging anxious attention. Utilitarianism, the “cheapest
market” theory, had triumphed in the establishment of unrestricted
competition, but the upshot of that competition
was an increasing strain and disorganisation of native labour.
With these evils he left the quickened spirit of “Young
England” to cope; while he himself strove to meet them by
the remission of the now unjust burdens laid on the land, his
industrial franchise bill, and his cherished policy of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sanitas
sanitatum</i>. He had, at any rate, largely influenced the opinion
of his generation in bringing home to men’s minds and consciences
the equality of the rights of Labour with those of
property, and the adequacy of constitutional forms to enforce
them; nor did he ever cease to press them in his writings
and speeches. But as a statesman he had always to choose
between evils; and of these a forced disturbance of a nationally
adopted system, which by hasty expedients might tend
to disorder and to dispersal, he ever considered the graver.
To experiment he always opposed experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Speaking only two years before his death, he <span class="locked">said—</span></p>

<p>“So far as I understand ... reciprocity is barter. I
have always understood that barter was the first evidence of
civilisation<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>—that it was exactly the state of human exchange
that separated civilisation from savagery.... My noble
friend (Lord Bateman) read some extracts, ... and he
honoured me by reading an extract from the speech I then
made in the other House of Parliament. That was a speech
in favour of reciprocity—a speech which defined what was
then thought to be reciprocity, and indicated the means by
which reciprocity could be obtained. I do not want to enter
into the discussion whether the principle was right or wrong,
but it was acknowledged in public life, favoured and pursued
by many statesmen who conceived that by the negotiation of
a treaty of commerce, by reciprocal exchange and the lowering
of duties, the products of the two negotiating countries
would find a freer access and consumption in the two
countries than they formerly possessed. But when my noble
friend taunts me with a quotation of some rusty phrase
of mine forty years ago, I must remind him that <em>we had
elements then on which treaties of reciprocity could be negotiated</em>.
At that time, although the great changes of Sir Robert Peel
had taken place, there were one hundred and sixty-eight
articles in the tariff which were materials by which you
could have negotiated, if that was a wise and desirable
policy, commercial treaties of reciprocity. What is the
number you now have in the tariff? Twenty-two. Those
who talk of negotiating treaties of reciprocity—have they
the materials?... <em>You have lost the opportunity.</em>... The
policy which was long ago abandoned, <em>you cannot now resume</em>.
You have at this moment a great number of commercial
treaties ... nearly forty, with some of the most considerable
countries in the world ... in which ‘the most-favoured-nation’
clause is included. Well, suppose you are for a system
of reciprocity as my noble friend proposes. He enters into
negotiations with a state; he says: ‘You complain of our
high duties on some particular articles. We have not many,
we have a few left; we shall make some great sacrifice to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
induce you to enter into a treaty for an exchange of products.’
<em>But the moment you contemplate agreeing with the
state, ... every other of the forty states with ‘the most-favoured-nation’
clause claims exactly the same privilege. The
fact is, practically speaking, reciprocity, whatever its merits, is
dead.</em>... The opportunity, like the means, has been relinquished;
and if this is the only mode in which we are to
extricate ourselves from the great distress which prevails,
our situation is hopeless. I should be very sorry to say,
whatever the condition of the country, its condition is
hopeless....”</p>

<p>“I cannot for a moment doubt that the repeal of the Corn
Laws—on the policy of which I do not enter—has materially
affected the condition of those who are interested in land.
I do not mean to say that this is the only cause of landed
distress. There are other reasons—general distress, the
metallic changes,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> have all had an effect. <em>But I cannot shut
my eyes to the conviction that the termination of protection to the
landed interest has materially tended to the condition in which
it finds itself. But that is no reason why we should retrace our
steps, and authorise and sanction any violent changes.</em> This
state of things is one which has long threatened.... It has
arrived.... I cannot give up the expectation that the energy
of this country will bring about a condition of affairs more
favourable to the <em>various classes</em> which form the great landed
interest of this country. I should look upon it as a great
misfortune to this country that the character, and power, and
influence of the landed interest and its valuable industry,
should be diminished, and should experience anything like a
fatal and a final blow. It would, in my opinion, be a misfortune,
not to this country alone, but to the world, <em>for it has
contributed to the spirit of liberty and order more than any other
class that has existed in modern times</em>.... But ... I cannot
support my noble friend when he asks us to pass resolutions
of this great character, and when he himself disclaims the
very ground (<i>i.e.</i> protection) on which he might have framed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
not what I think was a correct, but a plausible case. <em>It is a
very unwise course, in my opinion, when the country is not in a
state so satisfactory as we could wish ... to propose any inquiry
which has not either some definite object, or is likely to
lead to some action on the part of those who bring it forward.</em>
It would lead to great disappointment and uneasiness on the
part of the country; and the classes who are trying to realise
the exact difficulties they have to encounter ... <em>would
relapse into a lax state which might render them incapable of
making the exertions it is necessary for them to make</em>....
Looking into the state of the country, I do not see there is
any great mystery in the causes which have produced a state
of which there is undoubted general complaint. What has
happened in our own commercial failures during the last ten
years will explain it. The great collapse which naturally
followed the <em>convulsion of prosperity</em> which seemed to deluge
the world and not merely this country—the fact that other
countries have been placed in an equally disagreeable situation ... these
are circumstances which appear to me to
render it quite unnecessary to enter into an inquiry on this
subject.... I do not mean to say that there are not
moments ... in which an inquiry by Parliament ... into
the causes of national distress may not be allowable—may
not be necessary; but it must be a distress of a very different
kind from that which we are now experiencing. We must
have the consciousness that the great body of the people are
in a situation intolerable to them....”</p>

<p>Compare with this that passage from his late <cite>Endymion</cite>—a
novel of memories—where “Job Thornberry” (John Bright)
discusses this very problem with the hero.</p>

<p>“‘... But, after all,’ said Endymion, ‘America is as little
in favour of free exchange as we are. She may send us her
bread-stuffs, but her laws will not admit our goods, except on
the payment of enormous duties.’</p>

<p>“‘Pish!’ said Thornberry. ‘I do not care this for their
enormous duties. Let me have free imports, and I will soon
settle their duties.’</p>

<p>“‘To fight hostile tariffs with free imports,’ said Endymion,
‘Is not that fighting against odds?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
“‘Not a bit. This country has nothing to do but to consider
its imports. Foreigners will not give us their products
for nothing; but as for their tariffs, if we were wise men,
and looked to our real interests, their hostile tariffs, as you
call them, would soon be falling down like an old wall.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I confess,’ said Endymion, ‘I have for some time
thought the principle of free exchange was a sound one; but
its application in a country like this would be very difficult,
and require, I should think, great prudence and moderation.’</p>

<p>“‘... Ignorance and timidity,’ said Thornberry, scornfully.</p>

<p>“‘Not exactly that, I hope,’ said Endymion; ‘<em>but you
cannot deny that the home market is a most important element
in the consideration of our public wealth, and it mainly rests
on the agriculture of the country</em>.’”</p>

<p>To which “Thornberry” retorts that “England is to be
ruined to keep up rents.”</p>

<p>At all events, it is here, as elsewhere, evident what led
Disraeli to oppose the introduction of unregulated competition.
Things have long since marched quickly. The wall of tariffs
has not tottered; Disraeli never imagined that it would.
“Foreigners” now do sometimes “give us their products for
nothing” through those colossal “Trusts” that make enormous
profits at home to undersell us at a loss and capture our
markets abroad. Competition has been reduced to the
absurd. Nor is the Continent in that plight which marked
it when Disraeli uttered the speech above cited. All these
changed conditions require changing remedies, but the heroic
remedy lately advocated may well occasion thoughtful retrospect,
and the speech I have chosen may be profitably
pondered in this connection.</p>

<p>And can any reader of his utterances doubt that, had he
lived, he would never have left the problem of the housing of
the poor to private experiment, or merely municipal omniscience?
Thirty-three years ago he wrote as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p>“It is the terror of Europe and the disgrace of Britain,”
says “Lothair” of pauperism; “and I am resolved to
grapple with it. It seems to me that pauperism is not so
much an affair of wages as of dwellings. If the working<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
classes were properly lodged, at their present rate of wages,
they would be richer. They would be healthier and happier
at the same cost....”</p>

<p>I will conclude with an excerpt from Disraeli’s great
Crystal Palace speech of 1872. It concerns the remedies
which he had from the first determined to apply to a state of
things which the rush of so-called “progress” had induced.</p>

<p>“... It must be obvious to all who consider the condition
of the multitude with a desire to improve and elevate it, that
no important step can be gained unless you can effect some
reduction of their hours of labour and humanise their toil.
The great problem is to be able to achieve such results without
violating those principles of economic truth upon which
the prosperity of all States depends. You recollect that many
years ago the Tory party believed that these two results might
be obtained ... and at the same time no injury be inflicted
on the wealth of the nation. You know how that effort
was encountered, how these views and principles were met by
the triumphant statesmen of Liberalism. They told you that
the inevitable consequence of your policy was to diminish
capital; and this, again, would lead to the lowering of wages,
to a great diminution of the employment of the people, and
ultimately to the impoverishment of the kingdom.... And
what has been the result? Those measures were carried; but
carried, as I can bear witness, with great difficulty and after
much labour and a long struggle. Yet they were carried;
and what do we now find? That capital was never accumulated
so quickly; that wages were never higher; that the
employment of the people was never greater, and the country
never wealthier. I ventured to say a short time ago (<em>at
Manchester</em>) that the health of the people was the most important
subject for a statesman. It is ... a large subject.
It has many branches. It involves the state of the dwellings
of the people, the moral consequences of which are not less
considerable than the physical. It involves their enjoyment
of some of the chief elements of nature—air, light, and
water. It involves the regulation of their industry, the inspection
of their toil. It involves the purity of their provisions,
and it touches upon all the means by which you may wean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
them from habits of excess and brutality.... Well, it may
be the ‘policy of sewage’ to a Liberal member of Parliament.
But to one of the labouring multitude of England, who has
found fever always to be one of the inmates of his household—who
has, year after year, seen stricken down the children of
his loins, on whose sympathy and support he has looked with
hope and confidence; it is not ‘a policy of sewage,’ but a
question of life and death. And I can tell you this, gentlemen,
from personal conversation with some of the most
intelligent of the labouring class, that ... the hereditary, the
traditionary policy of the Tory party that would improve the
condition of the people, is more appreciated by the people
than the ineffable mysteries and all the pains and penalties
of the Ballot Bill.... Is that wonderful? Consider the
condition of the great body of the working classes of this
country. They are in possession of personal privileges—of
personal rights and liberties—which are not enjoyed by the
aristocracies of other countries. Recently they have obtained—and
wisely obtained—a great extension of political rights;
and when the people of England see that under the Constitution
of this country ... they possess every personal right of
freedom, and according to the conviction of the whole country,
also an adequate concession of political rights, is it at all
wonderful that they should wish to elevate and improve their
condition, and is it unreasonable that they should ask the
Legislature to assist them in that behest, as far as it is consistent
with the general welfare of the realm?...”</p>

<p>The crucial problem still exacts, though it need not baffle,
solution. We are still waiting for the complete answer to the
question here propounded by Disraeli.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subhead">CHURCH AND THEOCRACY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“The</span> equality of man,” exclaims Disraeli in <cite>Tancred</cite>,
“can only be accomplished by the sovereignty of
God. The longing for fraternity can never be
satisfied but under the sway of a common
Father ... announce the sublime and solacing principle
of theocratic equality.”</p>

<p>This is a Semitic idea; but, then, so is the Church. The
State, on the other hand, is an Aryan conception. The real
religion both of Athens and of Rome was the State. These
radical ideas of Church and State, to which we have grown
so accustomed, are, in fact, the products of special races and
the salvage of the centuries. The Romans invented
“Empire,” the Athenians “Democracy,” the Jews created
“Theocracy.”</p>

<p>It may be interesting to inquire how this idea of a spiritual
<em>Church</em>—a colony from the unseen and eternal—has
been in constant conflict with that other dominant idea of
the <em>State</em>; and how, among the nations, England alone
has made any serious or successful attempt to reconcile
them. For these are the ideas, expressed or implied, of
Disraeli. I take the liberty of illustrating these ideas afresh
in my own manner, and in continuous commentary, rather
than by considering isolated passages scattered through his
books and speeches, many of which I shall quote later on.
And the standpoint marked by the title of this chapter is the
point of view which seems to me to distinguish the many
varieties of the theme which he presents, and which evidently
fascinated him.</p>

<p>A <em>national</em> Theocracy has always been rejected in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
West. The Roman Church, whose ideal is an international
Theocracy under an imperial form, is in essence anti-national
and cosmopolitan; and for this very reason it became repugnant
to those Northern races whose genius makes for
nationality and independence. Moreover, it is unable itself
to flourish without the temporal appanage of a <em>State</em>; and
it therefore tends to become an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">imperium in imperio</i>. On
Western soil religion is unable to thrive as a living force
unless aided by the equipments of the <em>State</em>, which the
instinct of the West evolved, and to which it is prone; while
a non-organised, inorganic creed can no more make a
<em>Church</em>, which is a society of believers, than a paper
constitution can make a <em>state</em>, which is the community
individualised.</p>

<p>A <em>national</em> Theocracy failed also in the East because the
faculty for creating a <em>State</em> was deficient. When once
Theocracy, pure and simple, vanished from Palestine—“the
fatherland of the Spirit”—Israel and Judah were confronted
by their inherent inability to found a <em>State</em>. It was this,
indeed, which gave rise to the Messianic hope, a hope which
yielded to daily motherhood the consecration of divine
destiny. For to lend an effective earthly sanction to the
theocratic ideal, to reconcile without violence the government
of a community under the Eternal and Invisible with
the progress of a community under a visible chieftain, a
perfect monarch, the founder of a golden age, was required—a
theocrat king. The Jewish polity was a <em>Church</em>. All
European churches, on the contrary, are polities. This is
well recognised by Professor Ewald,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> who proves that the
<em>State</em>, as such, took no root and found no real place in
Palestine. The tentatives towards a <em>State</em> conflicted with
the native theocratic ideals of race aspiration, and failed to
survive them. And when at length the Incarnation displayed
the “Perfect King,” whose “kingdom was not of this world,”
but “within you,” and whose Kingship was “without observation,”
it was the very anti-nationalism of His teaching at a
period when Rome had tinged Palestine with Western politics
that perplexed or offended a perverse caste of fanatics athirst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
for national unity, although national independence had
crumbled away. When, once more, the Apostle to the Gentiles
laid the Pauline foundations of an international Christian
Church, the Jewish nationalism, despite the sublime prophecies
of Isaiah, grew doubly embittered, and closed its
ears to that theocratic message, which was, in fact, the fulfilment
of its highest aspirations.</p>

<p>For the ideal of the early Christian Church was undoubtedly
an <em>international Theocracy</em>. On this very account
it disgusted the Roman patriotism which despised it. But
directly it became acclimatised in the West, and prevailed, it
also underwent that modification of theocratic ideals which
the West always entails. It threw itself into the mould of
the <em>State</em>. It assumed the purple of the Cæsars; it “sent
forth its dogmas like legions into the Provinces.”</p>

<p>This only happens in Europe; in the East religions are
never politicised. The West seeks the tangible and turns to
myth the wonders that are literal to the Eastern mind. In
so far as the old Egyptian belief was in the priestly power, it
may perhaps be termed oligarchical, but not in the Western
sense. The Church of Buddha is a spiritual brotherhood,
never a <em>State</em>. Islam, like that from which it sprang, is
a Theocracy without any inherent organisation. Like it, it
eventually chose a monarchical headship; and, like it too, its
monarchy came to be cleft in twain. It is, I repeat, only in
the West that creeds are politicised. As the earthly sanctions
for Christianity coarsened through the centuries, it
became at once Cæsarian and cosmopolitan. But the warfare
between the so-called secular and spiritual powers, which,
indeed, forms the history of the earliest Middle Ages, soon
began to impair its birthright of cosmopolitanism. The
invincible bias towards nationality of the Northern races
asserted itself.</p>

<p>Dante, it is true, dreamed of a real Theocracy. But he
was a strong champion of a monarchical State. He staked
his hopes on that great Emperor—that “patriot king”—whose
premature death dashed his vision to the ground.
And after Dante, Savonarola craved a real Theocracy; but
it again assumed that Republican shape which, two centuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
later, was to play a greater, though as futile, a part in
England. The Church one way or another throughout
Europe perpetually tended towards becoming “a State within
the State,” a “King of kings;” and in this regard it is not
a little curious that the present Oratorians still obey the
antique Florentine Constitution which St. Philip of Neri
transcribed and embalmed as the rule of his order. In the
same way the early American Episcopalians brought with
them, in their three-yearly Conventions, that Triennial Parliament
which William of Orange grudgingly granted to the
Tories, and which Walpole was afterwards to repeal for the
Whigs. Once more, the Pilgrim Fathers brought the ideal
of Republican forms to America; but Republican forms soon
passed into democratic facts. From Jemima Wilkinson to
Mormonism and Christian science, sects and sectaries have
abounded. No religious vagary has lacked its audience and
its franchise. America exemplifies the disadvantage of lacking
a national comprehensive Church in a country whose
aspirations are national. Early in the seventeenth century
the Presbyterians persecuted the Quaker immigrants with
a ferocity of which Torquemada might have been proud; but
in their turn the American Presbyterians eventually fell a
prey to their own factions. While she was still a British
colony, England unwisely forced on America bishops consecrated
at home; but these very bishops were themselves
rejected admittance by persecuting Presbyterians,
who regarded Episcopalians as Jacobites, and taunted
them as Papists. It was the Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel that persistently sought to remedy the gross
anomaly of the Bishop of London being the Bishop of
America.</p>

<p>The Reformation in England was in its essence a national
protest against internationalism. Out of it flowed the notion
of a <em>national Church</em> like a “national party” (a contradiction
in terms but a most remarkable actuality), which it, in common
with France, theoretically justified as prior to Roman usurpation.
Our Church is one at once rooted in the soil as a civil
institution, a source of parish life, a security for local government,
a bar at once to oligarchy and bureaucracy, against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
exclusion of the many from public life,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> the trustee of an
estate which enables all to become proprietors of the soil,
which is, as Disraeli termed it, “the fluctuating patrimony of
the great body of the people;” and it is also by inheritance
one paramount in the country as a spiritual authority, an
educator, a social regenerator, and a mainspring of that tolerance
and religious liberty which the great Whig party secured
for our country. As Disraeli has pointed out repeatedly, the
union of Church and State means the hallowing of the civil
power, the investment of secular authority with religious
sanction, the loss of which the State would be the first to feel
and regret, should the bond be severed.</p>

<p>England, then, is the only nation that has reconciled
through compromise the spiritual ideas of Theocracy with the
dominant forms of the <em>State</em>.</p>

<p>But the English Church, headed by the English king, was
soon faced by Puritanism; and of this phase Disraeli, through
his father’s history, was a deep student.</p>

<p>Puritanism was cradled among small traders, conscious of
their virtues, but socially ill at ease. It at once became
terribly at ease in the courts of Zion. It began with a retail
outlook, and it soon politicised its creed. It became eminently
republican, nor was it ever democratic. Instinctively
counter to all forms, whether “temporal” or “spiritual,” it
aimed at the destruction both of Monarchy and the Church,
and yet it set up an exclusiveness of its own. The Jewish
Theocracy had, as I have pointed out, broken down even
under that monarchical shape which suited it, just because
its outward <em>State</em> apparatus was mechanical and out of touch
with the development of national life. The finer spirits of
Puritanism—and they were very fine—had these features to
reckon with. Cromwell, like Savonarola, compassed an impracticable
solecism. He desired a Republican Theocracy.
His scheme only chimed with that of the Church which he
sought to ruin in this, that he too wished religion to be nationally
organised—to be political. But the result was an intolerant
fanaticism of mutually persecuting sects, and a Parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
censorship of morals which cramped, nay, imprisoned self-developing
virtue, confounded holiness with austerity, and
furnished the best argument for a “national Church.”</p>

<p>Milton, who tempered the Puritanic fire with the Renaissance
light, who, in his youth, was a worshipper of the
subdued loveliness of the Church and “her dim, religious
light,” came to regard our national Church as merely, in his
own phrase, “an anti-papal schism.” Like Cromwell, he
longed to destroy it.</p>

<p>“It is a rule and principle,” he urges,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> “worthy to be
known by Christians, that no Scripture, no, nor so much as any
ancient creed, binds our faith or our obedience to any Church
whatsoever denominated by a particular name; far less if it
be distinguished by a several government from that which is
indeed Catholic.... It were an injury to condemn the papist
of absurdity and contradiction for adhering to his Catholic
Romish religion, if we, for the pleasure of a king and his
public considerations, shall adhere to a Catholic English.”
Milton only wanted republican instead of monarchical forms.
Politics were still the setting of religion. He was even more
inconsistent. He deprecated any discipline by the State,
although his Church was a political Church, and although
Cromwell’s purposes are contradicted by Milton’s very deprecation”
”If we think”—who can forget this fine passage
from his “Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing”?—“if
we think to regulate printing, thereby to rectify manners,
we must regulate all recreations and pastimes, all that is
delightful to men. No music must be set or sung but what is
grave and Doric.... I hate a pupil-teacher; I endure not
an instructor that comes to me under the wardship of an
overseeing fist.” How did Milton relish the Independents as
“pupil teachers,” or the “overseeing fist” of the Fifth-Monarchy
men, or the wardship of the Reign of Saints? Milton wants
neither the Church as a Polity, nor the State as a Church.
Not staying to inquire what fits the genius of England and
her national traditions and customs, he seeks a Theocracy
which is untheocratic, and a national republic doomed to fall
when the perfect ruler is removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
“When,” he indignantly exclaims<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>—“when God shakes a
kingdom with strong and healthful commotions to a general
reforming, it is not untrue that many sectaries and false
teachers are then busiest in seducing, but yet more true is it
that God then raises to His own work men of rare abilities and
more than common industry, not only to look back and revise
what hath been taught heretofore, but to gain further and to
go on some new enlightened steps in the discovery of truth.”
So, then, a reformed commonwealth, and no visible Church
are Milton’s ideals.</p>

<p>“The Parliament of England,” he protests, had turned
“regal bondage into a free commonwealth.” “All Protestants,”
he proceeds, “hold that Christ in His Church hath left
no vicegerent of his power, but Himself without deputy is
the only head thereof, governing it from heaven.” So far
Milton announces pure Theocracy; but the leaven of his
classical republicanism is disclosed in the next sentence: he
cannot divorce religion from politics. “How, then, can any
Christian man derive his kingship from Christ? I doubt not
but all ingenuous and knowing men will easily agree with me
that a free commonwealth, without a single person or House of
Lords, is by far the best Government, if it can be had.” And
then he propounds grand councils of a perpetual senate, safe-guarded
against “any dogeship of Venice,”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> as the means to
save the State. “The whole freedom of man,” he says,
“consists either in spiritual or civil liberty.” No rule for the
first is admitted by him but the Scriptures; for the second he
takes the Dutch model of the United Provinces. But he
neglects to consider how liberty can be settled without order,
or order without discipline, or discipline without authority, or
authority without creed.</p>

<p>Even the loftiest Puritan ideal of Theocracy, therefore, was
no less political than that of the Church.</p>

<p>A very few years witnessed the complete breakdown of a
system which sought to blend the early Latin and the early
Semitic ideals together in unnatural alliance, and disregarded
the native bias of Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
The ensuing reaction rendered the English Church more
political than ever. She was split into contending partisanship
for contending dynasties. She repudiated James the
Second, but not the Stuarts. Under William of Orange
latitudinarianism, even her latitudinarianism, was militant.
But under the two first Georges she grew torpid and
time-serving. The rash and rabid Sunderland, the astute
Walpole, parodied the old Miltonic ideals in their zeal for
indifferentism, and in self-defence the Church tended temporarily
to seem the mere stipendiary of the State, like an
excise officer. But Wesley in England, and Whitefield both
here and in America, re-aroused the Church to the higher
and holier ideals of a <em>national</em> Theocracy. Some century
later the Tractarian movement spurred her energies afresh,
and they have since been once more quickened in the battle
with mechanical materialism.</p>

<p>But all along it has been a sheer necessity in England—a
necessity for spiritual as well as civil <em>freedom</em>—that the
State should lend its earthly sanction of <em>order</em> to the Church.
A <em>national</em> Church so uncontrolled is impossible in England,
where politics tinge every form of aspiration. For international
Theocracy, for that “millenary year” which is the
magnificent ideal of Romanism, the times are unripe. It
must remain a remote goal so long as the competitive egoism
of nations, transfiguring the baser egotism of individuals and
of mere races, is paramount.</p>

<p>The Church State has been unrealisable. England alone
has realised the State Church. The former has been impossible
in the West, owing to the Aryan genius for State
development, and especially to the national instinct of the
Anglo-Saxon family. With the British spirit a cosmopolitan
religion is incompatible. No nation ambitious of being a
world-power can revert to Theocracy. It is not feasible
under such conditions.</p>

<p>The latter, however, the Anglican Church, has reconciled
these two concepts of opposite origins, the Oriental idea of a
“Church,” and the Occidental idea of the State. For it is
not only a religious, but a national and a social tradition.</p>

<p>This, I take it, was Disraeli’s attitude. By temperament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
he was theocratic. He believed in the original spirituality of
his race; but he also believed in the great destiny of the
nation to which he belonged, and in her Church he descried
the naturalised power of Semitic ideas, the only form in
which they could become nationally operative, the sole
political means in a political country of sanctifying the
secular. “The Church,” he once said, “is one of the few
great things left.” The Church ever found him a wise and
enthusiastic supporter. The fact is, as he put it in a speech
of 1860, “the Church is a part of England.” Nor would he
ever allow that mere differences of opinion negatived her
comprehensiveness. She was still Anglican. What he
recoiled from was the hard-and-fast narrowness of Puritanism,
the fiercer fanaticisms of which, he always maintained, had
undone Ireland. Sectarianism is not strength, for strength
resides in national discipline. He regarded a “national
Church” as the best pledge for religious liberty to even those
outside her communion, as a national refuge from bigotry
and a national rampart against priestcraft.</p>

<p>The Church’s “nationality” is proved even by the peculiar
character of her property. It is territorial. It is (as he
emphasised in a speech of 1862) “... so distributed throughout
the country, that it makes that Church, from the very
nature of its tenure, a national Church; and the power of
the Church of England does not depend merely on the
amount of property it possesses, but in a very great degree
on the character and kind of that property. Then I say
that the Church, deprived of its status, would become merely
an <em>episcopal sect</em> in this country. And in time, it is not
impossible it might become an insignificant one. But that
is not the whole, nor, perhaps, even the greatest evil, that
might arise from the dissolution of the connection between
Church and State, because in the present age the art of
government becomes every day more difficult, and no
Government will allow a principle so powerful as the religious
principle to be divorced from the influences by which it
regulates the affairs of a country. What would happen?...
The State of England would take care, after the Church was
spoiled, to enlist in its service what are called the ministers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of all religions. They would be salaried by the State, and
the consequences of the dissolution of the alliance between
Church and State would be one equally disastrous to the
Churchman and to the Nonconformist. It would place the
ministers of all spiritual influences under the control of
the civil power, and it would in reality effect a revolution in
the national character....”</p>

<p>De Tocqueville has proved that the French clergy were
the staunchest upholders of civil liberty before the Revolution;
but he has also acutely shown that the Roman priesthood,
devoid of domestic ties, looks to the Church as its sole
fatherland, unless it can itself become a proprietor of the soil.
The French Revolution disempowered it for that purpose,
and evicted it from its heritage. The English clergy, on the
other hand, are linked to civil life both by the land and the
home. Contrast for one moment the landscape of a French
village with that of an English, and the difference becomes
typified. In the one the church stands aloof and dominates
the hamlet. In the other it nestles among the cottages, and
helps the daily life around it.</p>

<p>What was present to Disraeli’s mind was not only that, in
such a case, the ancient landmarks of parish life, the ancient
trusts of education, the ancient equality of social intercourse
between clergy and laity, the ancient duties and intimacies,
the ancient openness to the poorest of career in the Church
and of residence on the land, would be swept away; but that,
as he expressed it when discussing the “Cowper-Temple
Amendment” in 1870, “you will not entrust the priest or
the presbyter with the privilege of expounding the Holy
Scriptures ... <em>but for that purpose you are inventing and
establishing a new sacerdotal class</em>.” “My idea of sacerdotal
despotism,” he said in 1863, “is this, that a minister of the
Church of England, who is appointed to expound doctrine,
should deem that he has a right to invent doctrine. That ...
is the sacerdotal despotism I fear....” The State
would suffer; and it would suffer doubly. Not only would
religion cease to be an official element of order, but the
ministers of religion might be unduly strengthened in civil
affairs—might be over-politicised. “Whether that is a result<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
to be desired,” he remarked ten years afterwards, “is a
grave question for all men. For my own part, I am bound
to say that I doubt whether it would be favourable to the
cause of civil and religious liberty.”</p>

<p>In his novels he emphasises his belief that society is
inconceivable without religion, and that “without a Church
there can be no true religion, because otherwise you have no
security for the truth,” although he also distinguishes between
differing “orthodoxies” and real religion. At the same time,
the Church as a polity must have dogmas—“No Church, no
creed”—“no dogmas, no deans, Mr. Dean.” The human
craving, the passionate instinct for religion, he ever based—from
the date of <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite> and <cite>Alroy</cite> to that of
<cite>Coningsby</cite> and <cite>Tancred</cite>, and from that of <cite>Tancred</cite> to that of
<cite>Lothair</cite>—on the fact that “<em>man requires that there shall be
direct relations between the created and the Creator, and that
in those relations he should find a solution of the perplexities of
existence</em>.”—“The brain that teems with illimitable thought
will never recognise as his Creator any power of nature, however
irresistible, that is not gifted with consciousness....
The Church comes forward, and without equivocation offers
to establish direct relations between God and man. Philosophy
denies its title and disputes its power. Why? Because
they are founded on the supernatural. What is the supernatural?
Can there be anything more miraculous than the
existence of man and the world? Anything more literally
supernatural than the origin of things? The Church explains
what no one else pretends to explain, and which every one
agrees it is of first moment should be made clear.”</p>

<p>Of the two passions which moved Disraeli, the one for
mastery, the other for the mysterious, the last was perhaps
the strongest. The mysteries that fascinated him were real,
and did not render him a mystic, still less a quietist. It is a
mistake so to regard him. His strength alike and his weakness
resided in the practical energy of his imagination. The
whole of existence was for him a standing miracle. “Contarini”
finds his fate by a vision in a church; “Venetia” receives
a miraculous answer to her prayer of agony. He delights to
depict, even in the short biography of his father, providential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
coincidences. What is deemed bizarre in his works, is
really the sense of magic wonder in all we experience.
His irony, too, contrasting show with substance and words
with things, works by paradox.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> That man is a spirit on
earth was his firm conviction. We find it accentuated from
his earliest utterances to his latest. “... There are some
things I know,” said the Syrian in <cite>Lothair</cite>, according with
the Syrian in <cite>Tancred</cite>, “and some things I believe. I know
that I have a soul, and I believe that it is immortal....”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
The riddle of life is not to be solved by theories, however
true or ingenious of the processes of development, still less
by the fashionable “prattle of protoplasm,” or the glib
triflers with their “We once had fins, we shall have wings.”
He was quite sincere and consistent in his famous “Ape or
Angel” dilemma. He believed, both passionately and
dispassionately, that man was divine. Science confesses that its
discoveries are merely of recurrent facts called laws; it does
not profess to account for them.</p>

<p>“Science may prove the insignificance of this globe in the
scale of creation,” said the stranger, “but it cannot prove
the insignificance of man. What is the earth compared with
the sun? A mole-hill by a mountain; yet the inhabitants
of this earth can discover the elements of which the great
orb exists, and will probably, ere long, ascertain all the conditions
of its being. Nay, the human mind can penetrate
far beyond the sun. There is no relation, therefore, between
the faculties of man and the scale in creation of the planet
which he inhabits.... But there are people now who tell
you there never was any creation, and therefore there never
could have been a creator.”—“And which is now advanced
with the confidence of novelty,” said the Syrian, “though all
of it has been urged, and vainly urged, thousands of years
ago. There must be design, or all we see would be without
sense, and I do not believe in the unmeaning. As for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
natural forces to which all creation is now attributed, we know
that they are unconscious, while consciousness is as inevitable
a portion of our existence as the eye or the hand. The conscious
cannot be derived from the unconscious. Man is
divine.... Is it more unphilosophical to believe in a personal
God omnipotent and omniscient, than in natural forces unconscious
and irresistible? Is it unphilosophical to combine
power with intelligence? Goethe, a Spinozist who did
not believe in Spinoza, said he could bring his mind to the
conception that in the centre of space we might meet with a
monad of pure intelligence. Is that more philosophical than
the truth first revealed to man amid these everlasting hills,”
said the Syrian, “that God made man in His own image?” ...
“It is the charter of the nobility of man ... one of the
divine dogmas revealed in this land; not the invention of
councils, not one of which was held on this sacred soil; confused
assemblies first got together by the Greeks, and then
by barbarous nations in barbarous times.”—“Yet the
divine land no longer tells us divine things,” said “Lothair.”
“It may, or may not, have fulfilled its destiny,” said the
Syrian. “‘In my Father’s house are many mansions,’ and
by the various families of nations the designs of the Creator
are accomplished. God works by races,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> and one was
appointed in due season, and after many developments, to
reveal and expound in this land the spiritual nature of
man....”</p>

<p>This quotation may suffice, though many others, even from
the biography of Lord George Bentinck, might have been
offered. These ideas are perhaps best summarised in the
Preface to <cite>Lothair</cite>. Disraeli really believed in the sacredness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
of the Syrian soil and air, the peculiar genius of the Semite
for communion with God, as of the Hellene for communion
with nature and origination of art; in the special religious
revelation vouchsafed to Semites alone and consummated
in Christianity, which he ever held was the fulfilment of
Judaism. The dogma of the Atonement he received literally.
It was a divine mystery enacted by a prince of Israel. Disraeli’s
sense of mystery was, let me repeat, literal, and
never explained through emblems. There was nothing of
Gothic symbolism in his nature. From these convictions
flowed his sanguine confidence in himself and his mission;
in destiny, which he has himself said may be but the
exertion of our own will. From these flowed his sympathy
with the heroic, his turn for the adventurous; his disrelish,
too, of modern rationalism, modern materialism,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> and even
of modern metaphysics.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> From these flowed his faith in
the revelations of conscience—“I worship in a Church where
I believe God dwells, and dwells for my guidance and my
good; my conscience;”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> in a word, from these flowed his
bias towards a natural Theocracy. But, as I have already
said, he recognised that the English Church had alone, as the
depository of these <em>racial</em> ideas, attuned them to the <em>national</em>
refrain of England, embodied them in living Western flesh.
Just as for him Government meant organised authority, and
Party organised opinion, so the Church meant organised
belief; nor did he ever cease to point out that if the national
Church were disestablished, if that form of Protestant religion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
resting on popular sympathies and popular privileges, which
had grown with the growth of England and had leavened her
life, her civil society, her public education, and even her pastimes,
were divorced from the principle of authority, not only
might the competition of sects cause a bigoted intolerance,
but the State itself would certainly be the loser.</p>

<p>I will choose another most pertinent passage from his
speech on the Irish Church Bill, delivered in March, 1869.
He had discussed “disendowment,” and he opposed it with all
his might, as the plunder of the Church in English history
had always gone into the coffers of the land, although it was
a trust for the poor.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” he continued, with regard to disestablishment,
“I myself am much opposed to it, because I am in favour
of what is called the union between Church and State.
What I understand by the union of Church and State is
an arrangement which renders the State religious by investing
authority with the highest sanctions that can influence the
sentiments, the convictions, and consequently the conduct of
the subject; while, on the other hand, that union renders the
Church—using that epithet in its noblest and purest sense—political.
That is to say, it blends civil authority with
ecclesiastical influence; it defines and defends the rights of
the laity, and prevents the Church from subsiding into a
sacerdotal corporation. If you divest the State of this connection,
it appears to me that you necessarily reduce both the
quantity and the quality of its duties. The State will still be
the protector of our persons and our property, and no doubt
these are most important duties for the State to perform.
But there are duties in a community which rather excite a
spirit of criticism than a sentiment of enthusiasm and veneration.
All, or most of the higher functions of Government—take
education, for example, the formation of the character
of the people, and consequently the guidance of their future
conduct—depart from the State and become the appanage
of religious societies, of the religious organisations of the
country—you may call them the various Churches, if you
please—when they are established on what are called
independent principles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
After welcoming the fact of a religious revival, he next
<span class="locked">continues:—</span></p>

<p>“When we have to decide whether we can dissociate the
principle of religion from the State, it is well to remember
that we are asked to relinquish an influence that is universal.
We hear in these days a great deal of philosophy. Now, it
is my happiness in life to be acquainted with eminent philosophers.
They all agree in one thing. They will all tell you
that, however brilliant may be the discoveries of physical
science, however marvellous those demonstrations which
attempt to penetrate the mysteries of the human mind, wonderful
as may be these discoveries, greatly as they have contributed
to the comfort and convenience of man, or confirmed
his consciousness of the nobility of his nature—yet all those
great philosophers agree in one thing—that in their investigations
there is an inevitable term where they meet the insoluble,
where all the most transcendent powers of intellect
dissipate and disappear.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> There commences the religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
principle. It is universal, and it will assert its universal
influence in the government of men. Now, I put this case
before the House. We are asked to commence a great
change.... When, therefore, we are called to the consideration
of these circumstances, it is absolutely necessary that
we should contemplate the possibility of our establishing a
society in which there may be two powers, the political and
the religious, and the religious may be the stronger.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Now I
will take this case. Under ordinary circumstances, a Government
performing those duties of police, to which it will be
limited when the system has perfectly developed, the first
step to which we are called upon to take to-night—such a
Government, under ordinary circumstances, will be treated
with decent respect. But a great public question, such as
has before occurred in this country, and as must periodically
occur in free and active communities—a great public question
arises, which touches the very fundamental principles of our
domestic tranquillity, or even the existence of the Empire;
but the Government of the country, and the religious organisations
of the country, take different views, and entertain
different opinions on that subject. In all probability the
Government of the country will be right. The Government
in its secret councils is calm and impartial, is in possession of
ample and accurate information, views every issue before it
in reference to the interests of all classes, and takes, therefore,
what is popularly called a comprehensive view. The religious
organisation of the country acts in quite a different manner.
It is not calm; it is not impartial; it is sincere, it is fervid,
it is enthusiastic. Its information is limited and prejudiced.
It does not view the question of the day in reference to the
interests of all classes. It looks upon the question as something
of so much importance—as something of such transcendent
interest, not only for the earthly, but even for the
future welfare of all her Majesty’s subjects—that it will allow
no consideration to divert its mind and energy from the
accomplishment of its object. It, therefore, necessarily takes
what is commonly called a contracted view. But who can
doubt what will be the result, <em>when on a question which enlists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
and excites all the religious passions of the nation, the zeal of
enthusiasm advocates one policy, and the calmness of philosophers
and the experience of statesmen recommend another. The
Government might be right, but the Government would not be
able to enforce its policy, and the question might be decided in
a way that might disturb a country or even destroy an empire.</em>
I know, sir, it may be said that though there may be some
truth in this view abstractedly considered, yet it does not
apply to the country in which we live, because ... we enjoy
religious freedom ... and because only a portion of her
Majesty’s subjects are in communion with the National
Church. I draw a very different conclusion to that which I
have supposed as the objection.... <em>It is because there is an
Established Church that we have achieved religious liberty and
enjoy religious toleration; and without the union of the Church
with the State, I do not see what security there would be either
for religious liberty or toleration.</em> No error could be greater
than to suppose that the advantage of the Established Church
is limited to those who are in communion with it. Take the
case of the Roman Catholic priest. He will refuse—and in
doing so he is quite justified, and is indeed bound to do so—he
will, I say, refuse to perform the offices of the Church to
any one not in communion with it. The same with the
Dissenters. It is quite possible—it has happened, and might
happen very frequently—that a Roman Catholic may be
excommunicated by his Church, or a sectarian may be
denounced and expelled by his congregation; but if that
happens in this country, the individual in question who has
been thus excommunicated, denounced, or expelled, is not a
forlorn being. There is the Church, of which the Sovereign
is the head, which does not acknowledge the principle of
Dissent, and which does not refuse to that individual those
religious rites which are his privilege and consolation....
Now, I cannot believe that the disendowment of the Church
of England could occur without very great disturbances....
<em>England cannot afford revolution. England has had her revolutions.
It is indeed because she had revolutions about two
hundred years ago, before other nations had their revolutions,
that she gained her great start in wealth and empire.</em> Now,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
sir, what have we gained by these revolutions? A period
of nearly two hundred years of great serenity and the secured
stability of the State. I attribute these happy characteristics
of our history to the circumstance, that in this interval we
did solve two of the finest and profoundest political problems.
We accomplished complete personal, and, in time, complete
political liberty, and combined them with order. We achieved
complete religious liberty, and we united it with a national
faith. These two immense exploits have won for this country
regulated freedom and temperate religion.... Speaking now
not as a partisan, I believe the Tory party, however it may
at times have erred, has always been the friend of local
government, and that <em>the instinct of the nation made it feel
that on local government political freedom depended</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>“It is said,” he remarked three years afterwards, after
commenting on the historical union between Church and
State—“two originally independent powers,” and the fact
that their alliance has prevented the spiritual power from
“usurping upon the civil and establishing a sacerdotal
society,” as well as the civil power from invading “the rights
of the spiritual,” and from degrading its ministers into
“salaried instruments of the Government.”—“It is said,” he
continued, “that the existence of Nonconformity proves that
the Church is a failure. I draw from these premises an
exactly contrary conclusion; and I maintain that to have
secured a national profession of faith with the unlimited
enjoyment of private judgment in matters spiritual is ... one
of the triumphs of civilisation.” Nonconformity he considered
a misfortune, though it was a symptom of national freedom.
With Nonconformists, however, he sympathised. It was with
indifference that he warred.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate these points. In an earlier speech he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
addresses himself to prove that the Church is none the less
truly national because millions of the nation are not in communion
with it; and he analyses Nonconformity.</p>

<p>“Now, the history of English Dissent will always be a
memorable chapter in the history of the country. It displays
many of those virtues for which the English character is
distinguished—earnestness, courage, devotion, conscience. But
one thing is quite clear, that in the present day the causes
which originally created Dissent no longer exist; while—which
is of still more importance—there are now causes in existence
opposed to the spread of Dissent. I will not refer to the fact
that many—I believe the great majority—of the families of the
descendants of the original Puritans and Presbyterians have
merged in the Church of England itself; but no man can any
longer conceal from himself that the tendency of this age is
not that all creeds and Churches and consistories should
combine—I do not say that, mind—but I do say that it is
that they should cease hereafter from any internecine hostility;
... and therefore, so far as the spread of ... mere
sincere religious Dissent is concerned, I hold that it is of a
very limited character, and there is nothing in the existence
of it which should prevent the Church of England from asserting
her nationality. For observe, the same difficulties
that are experienced by the Church are also experienced by
the Dissenters, without the advantage which the Church
possesses in her discipline, learning, and traditions.”</p>

<p>Part of these “difficulties” he considered in the later
speech, above cited, where he holds that the existence of
parties in the Church is a sign of vigour; but the other
part, the growth of indifferentism among millions of the
populace, he considers here, and he considers it as affording
a great field for the Church if it be true to its great traditions
and answers to the temper of the times and to the call of the
summons. “... If, indeed, the Church of England were in
the same state as the pagan religion was in the time of Constantine;
if her altars were paling before the Divine splendour
of inspired shrines, it might be well indeed for the Church
and its ministers to consider the course that they should
pursue; but nothing of the kind is the case. With the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
indifferentists you are dealing with millions of a people the
most enthusiastic, though not the most excitable, in the
world. And what awakes their enthusiasm?</p>

<p>“... <em>The notes on the gamut of their feeling are few, but
they are deep. Industry, Liberty, Religion, form the solemn
scale. Industry, Liberty, Religion—that is the history of
England.</em>” He predicts a feeling of exaltation for religion
similar to those enthusiasms for freedom and toil which have
inspired the nation in recent periods, and he harps on the
opportunity for a Church with a tradition of “the beauty of
holiness.” “What a field for a corporation which is not
merely a Church, but ... the Church of England; blending
with a divine instruction the sentiment of patriotism, and
announcing herself as the Church of the country;” which
may realise its nationality by increasing her hold on the
education<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> of the people, “though it is possible there may be
fresh assaults and attacks upon the machinery by which the
State has assisted the Church in that great effort;” by extending
the Episcopate (which has happened); by developing
the lay element in the administration of her temporal affairs;
by fulfilling the right of visitation both by priest and
parishioner, and maintaining those parochial privileges which
are still inviolate both in town and country; by remedying
the gross inequality of stipend (which remains to be done);
by, so far as possible, relying on the Church itself, and not
resorting to the Legislature.</p>

<p>With respect to indifferentism among the more enlightened
classes, it is “agnosticism,” partly due to the scientific spirit
on which I have touched; partly to that “higher criticism”
which Germany originated, and which, it is clear, can only
modify the views of an educated few. With the mild rationalism
of “Essays and Reviews,” Disraeli dealt characteristically.
He found them “at the best a second-hand medley of contradictory
and discordant theories.” Thirty years earlier he had
satirised those devout Christians who do not believe in Christianity.
As in the march of Science he perceived nothing new,
and held that it interpreted the imagery without sapping the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
foundations of belief, so with regard to the “Teutonic rebellion”
against inspiration, he saw only repeated in another form, and
with no more ability, the Celtic “insurrection” which distinguished
the eighteenth century: both had their uses.
“Man brings to the study of oracles more learning and more
criticism than of yore; and it is well that it should be so.”
Nay, the very development of the German theological school
proves its ephemeral character.</p>

<p>“About a century ago” (he observed in 1861) “German
theology, which was mystical, became by the law of reactions
critical. There gradually arose a school of philosophical
theologians which introduced a new system for the interpretation
of Scripture. Accepting the sacred narrative without
cavil, they explained all the supernatural incidents by
natural causes. This system in time was called Rationalism....
But where now is German Rationalism, and what are its
results? They are erased from the intellectual tablets of
living opinion. A new school of German theology then
arose, which, with profound learning and inexorable logic,
proved that Rationalism was irrational, and successfully substituted
for it a new scheme of scriptural interpretation called
the mythical.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> But if the mythical theologians triumphantly
demonstrated ... that Rationalism was irrational, so the
mythical system itself has already become a myth; and its
most distinguished votaries, in that spirit of progress which,
as we are told, is the characteristic of the nineteenth century,
and which generally brings us back to old ideas, have now
found an invincible solution of the mysteries of human existence
in a revival of Pagan pantheism.”</p>

<p>This he defined elsewhere as “Atheism in domino.” Since
Disraeli’s death the German school has made further strides.
There has been a brisk export of fresh theories “made in
Germany.” We are now told that the Old Testament is
Babylonian, and that the New springs out of Aryan ideas;
and side by side with this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tour-de-force</i> of paradox, an orgy of
anarchical hysteria threatens the sanctions of authority, the
secular as well as the spiritual. Disraeli would probably meet
it by what he retorted in the ’sixties, that when the periodical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
deluge subsides, the ark is seen resting at the summit of the
mountain.</p>

<p>But if education was to be secularised, might not the ark
be chopped up for firewood? Education was a problem that,
in its private and public aspects, engrossed Disraeli from his
youth. In the second of two election addresses at High
Wycombe in the memorable year 1832 he had announced:
“... By repealing the taxes upon knowledge, I would throw
the education of the people into the hands of the philosophic
student, instead of the ignorant adventurer.” He believed
that its current principles were constantly wrong—that words
were taught instead of ideas, and grammar studied instead of
character; and he was also a great advocate of the wisdom
of steeping the youth of a nation in national literature. It
was a keen disappointment to him that he was deprived of
the occasion of settling—partially, at any rate—the problem
of national education, and he considered that the less it was
fettered by direct State interference and the more it was
helped by State support, the better. He was persuaded that
any national system ought to be religious. For the Church’s
original training of the people, for her alliance with the
Universities, too, he had the keenest admiration.</p>

<p>“Nothing is more surprising to me,” he urged in 1872,
“than ... that in the nineteenth century the charge against
the Church of England should be that Churchmen, and
especially the clergy, had educated the people.... I think
the greatest distinction of the clergy is the admirable manner
in which they have devoted their lives and fortunes to this
greatest of national objects.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>It may not be generally remembered that only two years
after Disraeli entered the House of Commons he delivered
himself of a remarkable speech in this connection. He was
opposed, he said, at that time to a strictly State system, for
he was opposed to “paternal government, which stamped out
the sense of independence in man, and caused him to rely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
upon others.” Society should be strong, and the State weak;
order should not be disturbed by national injustice, nor liberty
by popular outcry. “<em>It is always the State and never Society—always
machinery and never sympathy.</em>” But though he did not
change the principles of his outlook, he came by experience
very materially to change his view of the machinery by which
they were to be applied. He detested the interferences of
centralisation; but a doubled population and the overgrowth
of cities rendered State measures imperative, and their
absence a disgrace. In his Edinburgh speech, twenty-eight
years later, he thus handled this national need: “... Ever
since I have been in public life I have done everything I
possibly could to promote the cause of the education of the
people generally. I have done so because I always felt that
with the limited population of this United Kingdom, compared
with the great imperial position which it occupies with
reference to other nations, it is not only our duty, but ...
an absolute necessity, <em>that we should study to make every man
the most effective being that education can possibly constitute
him</em>. In the old wars there used to be a story that one
Englishman could beat three members of some other nation.
But <em>I think if we want to maintain our power, we ought to
make one Englishman equal really in the business of life to
three other men that any other nation can furnish</em>. I do not
see otherwise how ... we can fulfil the great destiny that I
believe awaits us, and the great position we occupy.”</p>

<p>It will be noticed that he forecasts the practical and
technical requirements which, at a period of comparative commercial
decline, we are only now beginning to take to heart.</p>

<p>“Therefore,” he resumed, “so far as I am concerned,
whether it be a far greater advanced system of primary education—whether
it be that system of competitive examination
which I have ever supported, though I am not unconscious
of some pedantry with which it is associated—or whatever
may be the circumstances, I shall ever be its supporter.”</p>

<p>He kept his word. Leading the Opposition in 1870, he
supported Mr. Forster’s great measure, though he strongly
opposed the Cowper-Temple Amendment—one which has
undoubtedly kept much religious acrimony alive. His speech<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
on these clauses can still be studied with advantage. In
1854, Lord John Russell introduced his bill for the “good
government of the University of Oxford.” Here, again,
Disraeli objected to undue Government interference. He
thought that this “great seat of learning” should deal with
these problems itself independently, and in the spirit of the
age. It was designed to create professors on the Prussian
model. Disraeli showed that in Prussia there was then small
“sphere for the genius, the intellect, the talent, and the
energy of Germany, except in the professorial chair.” There
were not then great opportunities for a public career in
Germany. “In this country you may increase the salaries as
you please; but to suppose that you can produce a class of
men like the German professors is chimerical.... We are a
nation of action, and you may depend upon it that, however
you may increase the rewards of professors ... ambition in
England will look to public life.... You will not be able,
however you think you may, to lay your hand upon twenty-five
or thirty professors suddenly, capable of effecting a great
influence on the youth of England. You cannot get these
men at once. It will be slowly, with great difficulty, by
fostering and cultivating your resources, that you will be able
to produce one of these great professors—a man able to
influence the public opinion of the University. Whether, then,
you look to the great change which you propose with respect
to these private halls, which is in fact a revolution of the
collegiate system; or whether you look to the great alteration
you contemplate by the revival of the professorial instead of the
tutorial system—on both points you will meet, I think, with disappointment....
If I were asked, ‘Would you have Oxford,
with its self-government, freedom, independence, but yet with
its anomalies and imperfections; or would you have the University
free from those anomalies and imperfections and under
control of the Government?’ I would say, ‘Give me Oxford
free and independent, with its anomalies and imperfections.’”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
In the discipline of the Church itself also Disraeli
eventually found it imperative for the State to interfere. With
extreme Ritualism, with amateur popery in an alien camp,
effetely and sometimes treacherously practised, till the insubordination
of a few, who were not in any sense strong
men or leaders, began to infect the many, Disraeli could not
sympathise. The Mass of the Roman Church as a solemn
act he could reverence, but not the “masquerade” of
amateur ultramontanes. With the High Anglicans, with the
Tractarians, he in many respects sympathised profoundly.
Their movements were those of noble aspiration and high
endeavour. But most of the ultra-Ritualists were of wholly
different calibre. Their attitude he typified most humorously
in <cite>Lothair</cite>, and in the person of the “Reverend Dionysius
Smylie,” who was wont to observe, “Rome will come to <em>me</em>.”
Moreover, the Church had passed rapidly through varying
vicissitudes. In the late ’thirties and early ’forties there had
been a signal revival; but the secession of Newman, “apologised
for but never explained,” had proved a blow under
which “the Church still reels.” She lost a great, a generous,
a necessary leader, when a leader was her need. “If,” Disraeli
wrote in 1870, “a quarter of a century ago, there had
arisen a Churchman equal to the occasion, the position of
ecclesiastical affairs in this country would have been very
different from that which they now occupy. But these great
matters fell into the hands of monks and Schoolmen....”</p>

<p>In the ’fifties there was some degeneration, and the
revival of Convocation was not on the wider basis which
might have quickened clerical energy and lay enthusiasm.
In the ’sixties the Church began to be “in danger.” Radicalism
and Ritualism united; and there is a manuscript letter
of Disraeli, still extant, written at this period, and affording
some very interesting and secret knowledge.</p>

<p>What Disraeli disliked and regretted was that the choice
between faith and free thought should be more and more
presented as one between the Roman purple and the “Red
Republic.”</p>

<p>And this brings me to the consideration of Disraeli’s ideas
regarding the Latin Church, the immortal Rome, “that great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
confederacy which has so much influenced the human race,
and which has yet to play perhaps a mighty part in the
fortunes of the world.”</p>

<p>This imperial form of Theocracy exercised for him, both
imaginatively and historically, an enormous attraction. Its
special appeal to the Latin and Celtic races; its unbroken
phalanx of organisation; its immemorial persistence of
policy; its creative combination of spirituality with art, of
purity with beauty; its union of ideals beyond and above the
world with the mechanism of empires; its blend of contrasts,
of solemn softness with sombre control, of charm with
coldness, of callousness with charity, of loneliness with society,
of curse and comfort; its theoretic espousal of theological
free will with the practical denial of it in action, and of outward
pomp with inward simplicity; its watchful intimacies
with every moment of life—the way in which, as he puts it
in <em>Contarini</em>, it “... produces in” its “dazzling processions
and sacred festivals an effect upon the business of the day;”
its guardianship of the weak, the erring, and the poor; its
nursing motherhood of doubt and despair; its insidious captivation
of the will and intellect; its power to recall and
continue the spirits of the centuries, to absorb schism and
rebaptise it union; its claims to obliterate the past for the
penitent; to keep all things old and make all things new;
its great deeds and its great heroes; these elements and
many more, that have cooped Jews in Ghettos while blazoning
the proud inscription in front of St. Peter’s, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vicit Leo de
tribu Juda</i>,—all these opposites enchant even when they fail
to enchain the mind and the feelings. They have linked the
Vatican and the Palatine, the see to the throne, the tiara to
the diadem. They have transfigured, while maintaining,
pagan rites and customs, till “Madre Natura” reappears with
a halo, the very shrines of the Madonna repeat the antique
pattern of those dedicated to the Lares and Penates, and the
procession of waxen images in Southern Italy but perpetuates
another and an older ceremony. The Roman Church has
been the most consistent educator, the greatest organiser,
the most universal legislator of the last thousand years. It
has attained uncompromising ends unswervingly pursued by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
compromises the most subtle and the most skilful. Nor is the
esoteric doctrine which recalls the Eleusinian Mysteries, and
enables the initiated to regard forms comprehensible by the
multitude as merely popular symbols of higher truths, without
a certain glamour of its own. Disraeli’s father had penned
a treatise on the Jesuits, and their history had been deeply
studied by the son. I can still recall the unconscious tone of
ironical appreciation with which one of those “professors,”
“capable of effecting a great influence on the youth of
England,” informed me that when he met Disraeli, “he spoke
to me of the Jesuits.” Both the two factors in himself which
I have mentioned, the sense of mystery and the impulse to
control, are precisely the atmosphere of the Papal Church.
There was, therefore, to some extent the attraction of affinity.
But the Papacy appealed to him imaginatively, not theologically,
as it did to his great rival. I recollect being told
by a member of the symposium that Gladstone once discussed
deep into the night at Hawarden what form of Christianity
would eventually survive and prevail. Three chosen friends
agreed with him that it would be Romanism, the establisher
and not the establishment, the supernational and not the
national, theocratic and not (as Disraeli makes one of his
characters describe the Church of England) “parliamentary
Christianity.”</p>

<p>Not so Disraeli. Its political influences, its “clamour for
toleration,” its “labour for supremacy,”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> its warping limitations,
its prying priestcraft, its humble haughtiness, its casuistic
candour, its centralising forces fatal to Northern liberty,
the ban placed on free discussion and free intercourse, its
proclamation of the uniformity rather than of the unity of
human nature, and above all its admixture of paganism, were
the drawbacks that repelled him. “The tradition of the
Anglican Church was powerful,” he observes, adverting to
that “mistake and misfortune” of Newman’s desertion.
“Resting on the Church of Jerusalem, modified by the divine
school of Galilee, it would have found that rock of truth
which Providence, by the instrumentality of the Semitic race,
had promised to St. Peter. Instead of that, the seceders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
sought refuge in mediæval superstitions which are generally
the embodiments of pagan ceremonies and creeds.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>The spell of Romanism is an incident in <cite>Contarini
Fleming</cite>. The spell, but also the perils of Romanism, its
bewitchment of judgment and of conscience, its repugnance
to free politics and independent wills, its arrogance of inspiration,
its monopolies, its burdens of enjoined etiquette, form
the theme of <cite>Lothair</cite>. He cannot bind himself to the danger,
yet how adorable is its source! How firm the rock on which
it is founded, when it is not of offence! How certain the
conclusions, if only the premises can be conceded!</p>

<p>“Religion is civilisation,” said the Cardinal—“the highest:
it is a reclamation of man from savageness by the Almighty.
What the world calls civilisation, as distinguished from
religion, is a retrograde movement, and will ultimately lead
us back to the barbarism from which we have escaped. For
instance, you talk of progress: what is the chief social movement
of all the centuries that three centuries ago separated
from the unity of the Church of Christ? The rejection of the
Sacrament of Christian matrimony. The introduction of
the law of divorce, which is, in fact, only a middle term to
the abolition of marriage. What does that mean? The
extinction of the home and household on which God has rested
civilisation. If there be no home, the child belongs to the
State, not to the parent. The State educates the child, and
without religion, because the State in a country of progress
acknowledges no religion.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> For every man is not only to
think as he likes, but to write and speak as he likes....
And this system which would substitute for domestic sentiment
and Divine belief the unlimited and licentious action of
human intelligence and will, is called progress. What is it
but a revolt against God?”</p>

<p>What religious intelligence would not endorse these
truths! But let us now listen to the other side, that of
“other-worldliness,” of “the conversion—or conquest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
England,” though the allusions to “Corybantic Christianity”
are not without justice.</p>

<p>“There is only one Church and one Religion,” said the
Cardinal; “all other forms and phrases are mere phantasms,
without root or substance or coherency. Look at that unhappy
Germany, once so proud of its Reformation.... Look
at this unfortunate land, divided, subdivided, parcelled out in
infinite schism, with new oracles every day, and each more
distinguished for the narrowness of his intellect or the loudness
of his lungs; once the land of saints and scholars,
and people in pious pilgrimages, and finding always solace
and support in the Divine offices of an ever-present Church;
which were a true, though a faint type of the beautiful future
that awaited man. Why, only three centuries of this rebellion
against the Most High have produced ... an anarchy of
opinion, throwing out every monstrous and fantastic form,
from a caricature of the Greek Philosophy to a revival of
Feticism.... The Church of England is not the Church of
the English. Its fate is sealed. It will soon become a sect,
and all sects are fantastic. It will adopt new dogmas, or it
will abjure old ones; anything to distinguish it from the Non-conforming
herd in which nevertheless it will be its fate to
merge....”</p>

<p>“I cannot admit,” replied the Cardinal, “that the Church is
in antagonism with political freedom. On the contrary, in
my opinion, there can be no political freedom which is not
founded on Divine authority; otherwise it can be at the best
but a specious phantom of licence inevitably terminating in
anarchy. The rights and liberties of the people of Ireland
have no advocate except the Church, because there political
freedom is founded on Divine authority; but if you mean by
political freedom the schemes of the illuminati and the Freemasons,
which perpetually torture the Continent, all the dark
conspiracies of the secret societies, then I admit the Church is
in antagonism with such aspirations after liberty; those aspirations,
in fact, are blasphemy and plunder. And if the Church
were to be destroyed, Europe would be divided between
the atheist and the communist.”</p>

<p>This last opinion is Disraeli’s own. None knew better, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
realised more, the disintegrating terrors of the secret societies,
the propaganda of desperation served by desperadoes and
exploited by soldiers of fortune.</p>

<p>Disraeli appreciated and often testified that Roman Christianity
had pre-eminently spiritualised the once undecayed
Latin races. To its services and ideals he always paid the
deepest homage; for some of them he displayed an evident
affection. Nowhere has the higher aspiration of Romanism
been portrayed more touchingly than in the person of “Clare
Arundel.” The description in that book of the <cite>Tenebræ</cite>
vibrates with delicate emotion. In the same book he foresees
the erection on the site of slums of the stately fane which now
adorns Westminster. His public utterances on Ireland, on the
Maynooth question, and many others, his ardent championship
of the bill which secured the offices of his priest for
the Catholic prisoner, showed not only respect, but a
sympathy and conversance with Roman affairs passing that
of ordinary statesmen. But, as a statesman, he also realised
that the Roman Church was not only hostile to the Anglo-Saxon
instincts, but has always claimed a despotic temporal
dominion; and he also realised not only the earlier and
far-reaching designs of Cardinal Wiseman, but the later
diplomacies of a definite scheme for the capture, now that
absolutism is on the wane, of democracy. Rome means to be
the sole absolutism that shall survive. What Disraeli dreaded
and countervailed was the new-fangled alliance, not only
between Radicalism, but between Liberalism and Romanism.
In Ireland, as I shall show, a peculiar phase of the design was
apparent, and what Rome had manœuvred she came to
deplore and even to struggle to prevent. In <cite>Lothair</cite>, “Monsignor
Berwick,” Antonelli’s ultramontane disciple, is made to
say of “Churchill,” the leader of Irish Nationalism, “For the
chance of subverting the Anglican establishment, he is favouring
a policy which will subvert religion itself.”</p>

<p>In later times the famous encyclical <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rerum Novarum</cite>,
Monsignor Ireland and the “Knights of Labour” in America,
Cardinal Manning and the London Dock strikers, are an
evidence that Disraeli’s insight was sound.</p>

<p>The people as a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Civitas Dei</i>—the Church-State—is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
superb ideal, one with which Disraeli was in heartfelt accord.
But under what <em>national</em> forms is this to be compassed in
England? A desire that Anglican orders should be confirmed
by the Bishop of Rome has been during the last few
years publicly advanced by dignitaries of our own Church.
Is the Roman system capable of satisfying the progressive
demands of the masses in England? Though their sordid
homes need purifying, will they ever tolerate the intrusion of
their privacy by celibate priests? Is a doctrinal absolutism,
which the people themselves have dethroned from political
ascendency, likely to consummate the cosmopolitan dream?
State socialism divorced from ecclesiastical dominion would
never for one moment enlist the Pope. And if some form
even of State socialism ever became national (and Disraeli
could have withstood it to the death), how could Catholic
socialism control the socialism of the State? Can the
supreme voice of God brook the admonitions of the voice of
the people?</p>

<p><cite>Lothair</cite> treats more especially of the diplomacies of Rome,
and perhaps the polite struggle at “Muriel Towers,” between the
Cardinal and the Bishop for the hero’s soul, is one of Disraeli’s
most finished pieces of humour. “The Anglicans have only
a lease of our property, a lease rapidly expiring,” ejaculates
“Monsignor Berwick.” This imminent expiry of the lease is
undoubtedly a cherished hope of the Vatican and Sacred
College.</p>

<p>“Lothair,” it will be remembered, himself an earnest if
somewhat ineffectual youth, falls under the influence of “Lady
St. Jerome,” whose houses are rallying-centres for the great
Cardinal and his associates. “Lady St. Jerome” induces
“Lothair” to attend the office of the <cite>Tenebræ</cite>. He is told
that nothing in this particular service can prevent a Protestant
from attending it. This is followed by the master-gardener,
“Father Coleman’s” comments on the adoration of the Cross
in the Mass of the Pre-Sanctified, and a picnic with “Miss
Arundel” and the courtly “Monsignor Catesby.” “The
Jesuits are wise men; they never lose their temper. They
know when to avoid scenes as well as when to make them.”
“Lothair,” under the banner of his heroine, “Theodora,” fights<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
for Garibaldi and the “Madre Natura” against the Papal
troops. He is wounded at Mentana, and, by a coincidence,
tended by “Clare Arundel” and her Roman circle. On his
recovery, a miracle is announced concerning his rescue. The
Virgin has interposed to save a defender of the Faith. He
is led to a great function in the sacristy of St. George of
Cappadocia. He finds himself the centre of devout attraction.
The Cardinal assures him that the miracle is true.
“Lothair” indignantly protests and denies. The Cardinal
maintains that there are two “narratives of his relations with
the battle of Mentana.” “If I were you, I would not dwell
too much on this fancy of yours about the battle.” ... “I am
not convinced,” said “Lothair.” “Hush!” said the Cardinal;
“the freaks of your own mind about personal incidents, however
lamentable, may be viewed with indulgence, at least for
a time. But you cannot be permitted to doubt of the rest.
You must be convinced, and, on reflection, you will be convinced.
Remember, sir, where you are. You are in the
centre of Christendom, where truth, and where alone truth
resides.”</p>

<p>Nobody for one moment would believe that the illustrious
Archbishop of Westminster debased strategy to stratagem;
or could under any circumstances have resorted to a deliberate
lie. <cite>Lothair</cite> is a satirical fairy-tale, and “Cardinal Grandison”
is only an outward semblance of the late Cardinal
Manning. But this passage sheds a true light on Rome’s
attitude towards doubt, and her methods of proselytising; it
shadows her secular policy. Can any one deny that “the
truth with a mental reserve” of Jesuitry composes much of
the plot in the drama of the hierarchy? Moreover, the
passage agrees with a very remarkable one in a distinguished
French novel that appeared three years afterwards—“L’Abbé
Tigrane,” by M. Fabre. Long after these events, when
“Lothair” comes of age, his guardian, the same Cardinal,
converses with him on the impending Œcumenical Council.
The duologue contains a forcible summary of the Church’s
infallibility, however fallible may seem her individual
<span class="locked">members:—</span></p>

<p>“The basis on which God has willed that His revelation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
should rest in the world is the testimony of the Catholic
Church, which, if considered only as a human historical witness
of its own origin, constitution, and authority, affords the
highest and most enduring evidence for the facts and contents
of the Christian religion. If this be denied, there is no such
thing as history. But the Catholic Church is not only a
human and historical witness of its own origin, constitution,
and authority, <em>it is also a supernatural and Divine witness,
which can neither fail nor err</em>. When it œcumenically speaks,
it is not merely the voice of the Father of the World; it
declares ‘<em>what it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and
to us</em>.’”</p>

<p>No wonder that “Lothair,” sitting down in the crisis of
his life by the moonlit Coliseum, muses in a rhapsody of
the magnetism for opposed causes of the genius of the spot,
strangely anticipating Zola’s contrast between the new Italian
“Orlando” and the old Italian “Boccanera.”</p>

<p>“Theodora lived for Rome and died for Rome. And the
Cardinal, born and bred an English gentleman, with many
hopes and honours, had renounced his religion and, it might
be said, his country, for Rome; and his race for three hundred
years had given, for the same cause, honour, and broad
estates, and unhesitating lives. And these very people were
influenced by different motives, and thought they were
devoting themselves to opposite ends. But still it was Rome;
Republican or Cæsarian, papal or pagan, it still was Rome.”</p>

<p>I have shown the sources, as I believe, of Disraeli’s convictions.
He was the first to dwell on those problems of
race which are now recognised. His derided “Asian
mystery” has been amply justified. His view of the “Caucasian”
is that of subsequent science. Writing nearly forty
years after he had mooted his ideas, he observed: “familiar
as we all are now with such themes ... the difficulty and
hazard of touching for the first time on such topics cannot
now be easily appreciated.” His beliefs were <em>racial</em>, and
depended on the clue of race to history. Their applications,
however, were <em>national</em>. For he knew that race is only an
element among the shared associations and common language,
customs and history, that make up that ideal assembly which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
is called a nation; and he also knew that mere communication
is not communion; that the rapidity of increased methods
of material intercourse will never extinguish the slow, but
certain, fires of race discord, which can only “consume its
own smoke” through the free fusion of nationality.</p>

<p>His own race he cleared from prejudice, and proudly displayed
as a potent, if sometimes hidden, force throughout the
world. His praise and illustration of its endowments, its
strength by virtue of its purity of strain, its tenacity and
power of organisation, its veiled ramifications among the
mainsprings that move Governments and alter systems, no
longer raise a smile; and if they did, they would certainly
cease to do so when placed on the lips of Macaulay, who
thus treated <span class="locked">them—</span></p>

<p>“He knows,” said Macaulay, speaking in 1833 of the
member for the University of Oxford—“he knows that in
the infancy of civilisation, when our island was as savage as
New Guinea, when letters and arts were still unknown to
Athens, when scarcely a thatched hut stood on what was
afterwards the site of Rome, this contemned people had
their fenced cities and cedar palaces, their splendid Temple,
their fleets of merchant ships, their schools of sacred learning,
their great statesmen and soldiers, their natural philosophers,
their historians and their poets.... Let us open
to them every career in which ability and energy can be
displayed. Till we have done this, let us not presume to
say that there is no genius among the countrymen of Isaiah,
or heroism among the descendants of the Maccabees.”</p>

<span class="subhead">MONARCHY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“To</span> change back the oligarchy into a generous aristocracy
round a <em>real throne</em>,” Disraeli ranks, with
his ideal mission towards the Church, as “the trainer
of the nation;” towards Labour, to “the moral
and physical condition of the people;” towards Ireland, by
governing it “according to the policy of Charles I., and not
of Oliver Cromwell;” to Reform, by emancipating “the
political constituency of 1832 from its sectarian bondage and
contracted sympathies.”</p>

<p>“Sovereignty,” he says, in the peroration to <cite>Sybil</cite>, “has
been the title of something that has had no dominion, while
absolute power has been wielded by those who profess themselves
the servants of the people. In the selfish strife of
factions, two great existences have been blotted out of the
history of England—<em>the Monarch and the Multitude</em>; as the
power of the Crown has diminished, the privileges of the
people have disappeared....” Such was Disraeli’s summary
in 1870 of what inspired “Young England” in 1840.
The more real is representation, the greater the chances of
royalty. De Tocqueville, too, has shown that it was just the
decay of mediæval, municipal institutions that loosened the
hold of the French Crown on the French nation.</p>

<p>The “real throne,” as against the ornamental, formed a very
material part of it. It chimed with Disraeli’s outlook on
English institutions as “popular, but not democratic.” Since
<cite>Sybil</cite> was written, the “subject” is no longer “a serf,” but
for a long time the “sceptre” tended to remain “a pageant.”
The constitutional possibilities and opportunities of kingship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
under our limited monarchy are even now, perhaps, hardly
realised. Before I close this chapter, I intend to say something
of their historical lineage.</p>

<p>There is a satirical passage about George the Fourth
among the brilliant flippancies of <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, which may
amuse us before coming to close quarters with the serious
side of sovereignty: “The first great duty of a monarch is to
know how to bow skilfully. Nothing is more difficult, ... a
royal bow may often quell a rebellion, and sometimes crush
a conspiracy. Our own Sovereign bows to perfection. His
bow is eloquent, and will always render an oration ... unnecessary,
which is a great point, for harangues are not regal.
Nothing is more undignified than to make a speech. It is
from the first an acknowledgment that you are under the
necessity of explaining, or conciliating, or convincing, or
confuting; in short, that you are not omnipotent, but opposed.”</p>

<p>“The Monarchy of the Tories is more democratic than
the Republic of the Whigs!” exclaimed Disraeli, as I have
already quoted, in his early <cite>Spirit of Whiggism</cite>. “I think,”
cried Canning in 1812, “that we have the happiness to live
under a limited monarchy, not under a crowned republic;”
while, six years later, Canning again denounced most forcibly
the error of those “who argue as if the constitution of this
country was a broad and level democracy inlaid (for ornament’s
sake) with a peerage and topped (by sufferance) with
a crown.” This belief inspired the same statesman when,
towards the agitated close of his days, he speaks in a letter
to Mr. Croker of his reliance on the “vigour of the Crown”
in conjunction with the “body of the people.”</p>

<p>This, too, was the belief that inspired Disraeli. “<em>The
monarch and the multitude.</em>” Monarchy should be neither a
gewgaw nor an abstraction, but a centre of national enthusiasm.
“It is enthusiasm alone that gives flesh and blood to
the skeletons of opinions.” From the beginning of the first
to the close of the fifth decade of last century kingship had
been on its trial in England. “The Tories,” wrote Disraeli
in <cite>The Press</cite>, “already recognised the necessity of employing
all the popular elements of the Constitution in support of its
monarchical foundation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Just as I have shown with regard to the Church, his predisposition
lay towards pure Theocracy, but his practical bent
discerned in a national Church its aptest and most congenial
embodiment; so with regard to kingship his predisposition lay
towards pure monarchy—royal leadership—which he knew, and
indeed hoped, could in England never prove absolute, still
less arbitrary. But a British king retains the great advantage
of being outside the prejudices of every order in the State
of which he is the social chieftain. The tendency, mused
“Sidonia,” of “advanced civilisation was to ‘pure monarchy;’”
“Monarchy is indeed a government which requires a high
degree of civilisation for its fulfilment.” Public opinion,
absorbing so many functions of control, training, and discussion,
should find in the king a disinterested exponent. “In
an enlightened age, the monarch on the throne, free from the
vulgar prejudices and the corrupt interests of the subject,
again becomes divine.” But this was said with regard to
France, and in answer to “Coningsby’s” hazard that the republic
of that country might absorb its kingdom, and Paris<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
the provinces. It was a dream. None felt more deeply than
Disraeli that English tradition was the temper of England.
None, more than he, deprecated centralisation. The very
value of her “glorious institutions” is, as he often insists, that
they foster, in a form above the passions of momentary outburst
or fickle reactions, those great elements of loyalty,
religion, industry, liberty, and order which have conjoined
to make and keep her great. Representing classes, they
humanise virtues. The problem since the Revolution has
always been how to bring the varying force of public opinion,
the power of Parliament, and the cabinet system, which has
gradually crystallised, into line with the ancient and beneficial
personality of the Crown; in later times, how to reconcile
the King both to Downing and also to Fleet Street; how to
harmonise the dependence of his just limits with the independence
of his just influence; how to render him no mere
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roi fainéant</i>, or marionette to be danced on the wires of
patricians or tribunes, but a real representative individuality;
how he may rule as well as reign; and all this, in this country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
and in this century, without assuming any kind of either
fatherly or of stepfatherly meddlesomeness; for the “Patriot
King” must never take even a tinge of the Patriarch. He
must be one, whatever else he may be, who “thinks more of
the community and less of the government.” He must, in
a word, bear himself as a chief, and not as a master.</p>

<p>As Byron sang, bearing Bolingbroke in <span class="locked">mind—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“A despot thou, and yet thy people free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the <em>heart</em>, not hand, enslaving us.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The monarch, thought Disraeli, embodies the national
elements in a form of abiding and unarbitrary influence; he
is above interest and beyond party; his position prevents,
his functions collide with, any favouritism of any class. A
King at one with public opinion can prove a real check on
individual designs, ministerial mistakes, private cajoleries,
public passions. “The proper leader of the people is the
individual who sits upon the throne.”</p>

<p>“‘And yet,’ said Coningsby, ‘the only way to terminate
what is called class legislation is not to entrust power to
classes.... <em>The only power that has no class sympathy is
the Sovereign.</em>’</p>

<p>“‘But suppose the case of an arbitrary Sovereign, what
would be your check against him?’</p>

<p>“‘The same as against an arbitrary Parliament.’</p>

<p>“‘But a Parliament is responsible ... to its constituent
body.’</p>

<p>“‘Suppose it was to vote itself perpetual?’</p>

<p>“‘But public opinion would prevent that.’</p>

<p>“‘And is public opinion of less influence on an individual
than on a body?’</p>

<p>“‘But public opinion may be indifferent. A nation may
be misled—may be corrupt.’</p>

<p>“‘If the nation that elects the Parliament be corrupt, the
elected body will resemble it.... But this only shows
that there is something to be considered beyond forms of
government—national character....’</p>

<p>“‘But do you then declare against Parliamentary government?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
“‘Far from it. <em>I look upon political change as the greatest
of evils, for it comprehends all.</em> But if we have no faith in
the permanence of the existing settlement—if the very individuals
who established it are year after year proposing
their modifications or their reconstructions—so, also, while
we uphold what exists, ought we to prepare ourselves for the
change we deem impending. Now, I would not that either
ourselves or our fellow-citizens should be taken unawares as
in 1832, when the very men who opposed the Reform Bill
offered contrary objections to it which destroyed each other,
so ignorant were they of its real character, historical causes,
its political consequences.... For this purpose I would
accustom the public mind to the contemplation of an existing
though torpid power in the constitution, capable of removing
our social grievances.... <em>The House of Commons is the
house of a few; the Sovereign is the sovereign of all.</em>’”</p>

<p>Now, undoubtedly the period to which these words refer
was one when certain Whig leaders contemplated an oligarchical
republic, and wished to compass their aim by an
undue exaltation of the Lower House, as, in 1718, Sunderland
had wished to attain the same end by that of the Upper. No
student of the Croker Papers can fail to recognise the
fact, and undoubtedly Disraeli thought—and Sir Robert Peel
thought so too—that the times were ripe for reviving those
constitutional prerogatives, those kingly privileges which
form the Crown’s sole direct representative faculty in the
constitution, of which the Crown had long been robbed, first
by its own alternate abuse or incapacity to use them, afterwards
by faction itself often imitating the royal errors. And
so the executive power had passed almost wholly into
ministerial hands. After 1830 the prerogatives which, as I
shall show, Mr. Gladstone champions, seemed falling into
entire abeyance. In 1836, before he had entered Parliament,
Disraeli had, in the <cite>Runnymede Letters</cite>, where he spoke of
“the people of England sighing once more to be a nation,”
called on Sir Robert Peel to achieve “a great task in a great
spirit”—“<em>rescue your Sovereign from an unconstitutional thraldom</em>;
rescue an august Senate which has already fought the
battle of the people; rescue our National Church which our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
opponents hate, our venerable constitution at which they scoff;
but, above all, rescue that mighty body of which all these great
classes and institutions are but one of the constituent and
essential parts—rescue the <em>nation</em>.”</p>

<p>In 1837, “our young Queen and our old Institutions”
were no mere catchwords. And it seems unquestionable, also,
that the subsequent interferences of Baron Stockmar, the late
Queen’s early tutelage to Lord Melbourne, the circumstances
attendant on her happy marriage, the peculiar treatment of
Prince Consort by her first ministers, and the long retirement
due to private grief, contributed in successive combination
towards that invisibility, so to speak, of her royal office, which
prevailed, though it did not, however, eventually preclude her
very real and valuable exercise of it. In England the only
true blemish of our party system, which Disraeli vehemently
fought to uphold, is, as he more than once urged, that it tends
to “warp the intelligence.” To this fault the wisdom of a
constitutional and popular monarch, above and beyond party,
offers an antidote.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel, in the very year of Queen Victoria’s
accession, writes to Croker as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p>“... The theory of the constitution is that the King has
no will except in the choice of his ministers.... <em>But this,
like a thousand other theories, is at variance with the fact.</em>
The personal character of the sovereign ... has an immense
practical effect.... There may not be violent collisions
between the King and his Government, but his influence,
though dormant and unseen, may be very powerful. Respect
for personal character will operate in some cases; in others
the King will have all the authority which greater and more
widely extended experience than that of any single minister
will naturally give. A King, after a reign of ten years, ought
to know much more of the working of the machine of government
than any other man in the country. <em>He is the centre to
which all business gravitates.</em> The knowledge that the King
holds firmly a certain opinion, and will abide by it, prevents
in many cases an opposite opinion being offered to him....
The personal character of a really constitutional King, of
mature age, of experience in public affairs, and knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
manners, and customs, is practically so much <em>ballast</em>, keeping
the vessel of the State steady in her course, countervailing the
levity of popular ministers, of orators forced by oratory into
public councils, the blasts of democratic passions, the groundswell
of discontent, and ‘the ignorant impatience for the
relaxation of taxation.’ ... The genius of the Constitution
had contrived this in times gone by.</p>

</div>

<p>Sir Robert’s idea, then, of a constitutional sovereign was
that of an unseen driver who holds the reins from within.
The sailor-king of narrow mind but broad sympathies, just
departed when Peel wrote, had not proved a cipher. He
insisted on being for a space Lord High Admiral, despite
Croker’s ungenerous retort that James II. had done the same.
In 1828 he had offered wise advice to his ministers as to the
unripeness of the times for a change in the form then proposed,
which touched his heart. On his accession he emphatically
expressed his pleasure in retaining his ministers. And, though
he composed a couplet so bad that it might have been the
jingle of <span class="locked">Harley—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<i>A dissolution</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Means revolution</i>,”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">yet throughout the brief and perplexed span of his reign he
honestly tried to accord with the whole nation as opposed
to cliques and sections of it that assumed the title of “the
people.” The fact was that he acceded during one of those
crises when the balance of power was shifting, and, his intellect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
being mediocre, he became bewildered. The new, the legitimate,
the organised predominance of public opinion clashed
with Parliament, and was played upon by ambitious ministers.
William the Fourth lived in just fear and blunt defiance of
that “Venetian oligarchy” which ever since 1704 had been
the recurrent ideal of the place-engrossing, great revolution
families. What he apprehended was foiled, principally by the
personality of Sir Robert Peel, whom he summoned to his
aid. Henceforward the monarchy became, as it ought long
before to have become, completely, if gradually, popularised.
When monarchy is popular, the invisibility of its office ceases
to be an expedient. “... I think,” said Disraeli, in a speech
of 1850, “it one of the great misfortunes of our time, and one
most injurious to public liberty, that the power of the Crown
has diminished.”</p>

<p>With Victoria and our present King—if we except a very
transient spasm of George III., whose first essay to be a
“patriot king” had been to dismiss and thwart the most
popular minister that England has ever had—monarchy has
for the first time during nearly two centuries proved wholly
and nationally popular. Before the Stuarts, Elizabeth had
ruled by the sole virtue of her popularity; she had “inflamed
the national spirit,” and the checks introduced by the
Revolution were only a necessity for unpopular sovereigns.
The Press has now introduced a far greater check than any of
these. Now that the nation is in full unison with the Crown,
the King is doubly entitled to support the nation in hours of
befitting emergency against the cabals or passions of a person,
a clique, or a class. A modern English King is too cognisant
of the popular feeling eloquent in an unbridled press ever to
violate it; he could not do so with impunity. The last surrender
of “independent kingship,” which Mr. Gladstone has noted, and
others after him, was in 1827, when a weak sovereign renewed
the “charter of administration of the day.” There is no
pretext now for a King to yield or hide his just and popular
privileges to serve the turn of ministers. The necessity for a
“monarch of Downing Street” has disappeared.</p>

<p>Disraeli adverted to some of these topics at Manchester
in 1872, long after the events of those times had passed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
but when “the banner of republicanism” was once again
unfurled.</p>

<p>“... Since the settlement of that constitution, now nearly
two centuries ago, England has never experienced a revolution,
though there is no country in which there has been so
continuous and such considerable change. How is this?
Because the wisdom of your forefathers placed the prize of
supreme power without the sphere of human passions. Whatever
the struggle of parties, whatever the strife of factions,
whatever the excitement and exaltation of the public mind,
there has always been something in this country round which
all classes and powers could rally, representing the majesty
of the law, the administration of justice, and involving at
the same time the security for every man’s rights and the
fountain of honour.” And then, after emphasising the non-partisanship
of the Crown, the very end which Bolingbroke
forecasted at the time when an unemancipated King was
condemned to be a party man, he led the discussion to the
conventional views of the King being not only outside politics,
but outside affairs.</p>

<p>“... I know it will be said that, however beautiful in
theory, the personal influence of the Sovereign is now absorbed
in the responsibility of the minister. I think you will
find there is a great fallacy in this view. The principles of
the English Constitution do not contemplate the absence of
personal influence on the part of the Sovereign; and if they
did, the principles of human nature would prevent the fulfilment
of such a theory.” He is here in complete accord with
Peel. “Even,” he says, “with average ability, it is impossible
not to perceive that such a Sovereign must soon attain a
great mass of political information and political experience.
Information and experience, ... whether they are possessed
by a Sovereign or by the humblest of his subjects, are irresistible
in life.... The longer the reign, the influence of that
Sovereign must proportionately increase. All the illustrious
statesmen who served his youth disappear. A new generation
of public servants rises up. There is a critical conjuncture
in affairs—a moment of perplexity and peril. Then it is that
the Sovereign can appeal to a similar state of affairs that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
occurred perhaps thirty years before. When all are in doubt
among his servants, he can quote the advice that was given
by the illustrious men of his early years, and though he may
maintain himself within the strictest limits of the Constitution,
who can suppose, when such information and such suggestions
are made by the most exalted person in the country, that
they can be without effect? No; ... a minister who could
venture to treat such influence with indifference would not be
a Constitutional minister, but an arrogant idiot....” And
in another speech of the same year, after insisting that
English attachment to English institutions was no “political
superstition,” but sprang from a resolve that “<em>the principles of
liberty, of order, of law, and of religion ought not to be entrusted
to individual opinion, or to the caprice and passion of multitudes,
but should be embodied in a form of permanence and power</em>,”
he also remarked: “... We associate with the Monarchy
the ideas which it represents—the majesty of law, the administration
of justice, the fountain of mercy and honour.” He
might, in fitness with his other pronouncements, have added
the ideas of loyalty and of leadership. Again, in 1871, a
moment of republican revival, adverting to the superintendence
of public business by the Sovereign, he insisted that
“... there is not a dispatch received from abroad, or sent
from this country abroad, which is not submitted to the
Queen.... Those Cabinet Councils, ... which are necessarily
the scene of anxious and important deliberations, are
reported and communicated, ... and they often call from
her critical remarks requiring considerable attention....
No person likely to administer the affairs of this country
would treat the suggestions of Her Majesty with indifference,
for at this moment there is probably no person living who
has such complete control over the political conditions....
But, although there never was a Sovereign who would less
arrogate any power or prerogative which the Constitution
does not authorise, so I will say there never was one more
wisely jealous of those which the Constitution has allotted to
her, because she believes they are for the welfare of her
people.”</p>

<p>It is by its constitutional prerogatives that, in the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
place, the Crown can assert its lawful influence. They confer
on him a deciding power in many spheres. Of these prerogatives
Disraeli was a champion; and Mr. Gladstone upheld
them in at least two interesting discussions among his
“Gleanings.”</p>

<p>To defer the most obvious among these, the King’s consultative
faculty, “the power,” to cite Mr. Gladstone, “which
gives the monarch an undoubted <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">locus standi</i> in all the
deliberations of a Government, ... remains as it was.” In
olden days this was effected openly in form. Nor should it be
forgotten that whenever a Ministry is changed, again to cite
Mr. Gladstone, “the whole power of the State periodically
returns into the royal hands.” In 1852, when Lord Derby
reluctantly consented to assume office with a minority, there
were forty-eight hours when, as Disraeli pointed out in a
speech of 1873, “the Queen was without a Government.”
Then take the royal prerogative of dissolution. This right
enabled, in 1852, that very administration to perform the
work of the session, and to carry the supplies before appealing
to the constituencies on its right to exist. It is in effect a
right of appeal by the Sovereign through or even against
(should he deem it their duty to take the national voice) his
ministers to the country; and in any crucial instance it
forms the best check to faction of which our Constitution
admits.</p>

<p>Further, there exists the admitted prerogative, openly
exercised, of choice of ministers. This was the main arena
of party cleavage under the greater portion of the sway of
George III. It was this which, as Mr. Gladstone also mentions,
was unsuccessfully, but neither unwholesomely nor
unfairly, pressed into popular service in 1834. And, among
many others remaining, there is that to appoint bishops—a
stalking-ground of contention during the reign of Anne, and,
in the Victorian era, signalised by Dr. Hampden’s appointment
against a remonstrant primate. There is the prerogative
of the Royal Warrant utilised by Mr. Gladstone himself in
the repeal of the Purchase Act. There is the prerogative of
disapproving the choice of Speaker, which will probably cease.
There is that for proposing grants of public money, and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
is the salutary initiative of Royal Commission which paves
the way for social reform. On these personal rights I need
not dwell. But on the prerogative of peace and war a word
must be said. Had it been withheld for hostilities in the
Crimea, a needless complication of Europe need never have
occurred.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> We may conjecture that its influence was not
absent from our recent peace in South Africa. Mr. Gladstone
has instanced the Chinese war, some fifty years ago, as an
example of carrying on a conflict believed to be necessary
despite its condemnation by “the stewards of the public
purse.” The Sovereign has also the undoubted right to
consult with his ministers, and to attend the deliberations
of his Cabinet. Queen Anne did this habitually, and the
fatal movement of her fan decided great issues on more than
one occasion. The first two Georges used on occasion, but
with indifference where money was not concerned, to do the
same. Since then it has fallen into disuse, and perhaps the
end is better served by the premier’s audiences with his
King. But I may here be permitted to hope that when the
great intercolonial council which is in the air has taken shape,
the Sovereign may deign to be its President. Such a decision
would be in complete accord with the policy of Disraeli, who
affirmed in 1876, “No one regrets more than I do that
favourable opportunities have been lost of identifying the
colonies with the royal race of England.”</p>

<p>The prerogatives are the royal faculties for independent
expression. But it is obviously not by prerogative mainly
or alone that the Crown rivets and can mould a nation.
The Crown is a many-sided emblem. It is the centre of
English unity, a focus of consolidation and compactness;
while it also represents Great and Greater Britain abroad.
As a source of home sympathy, as the embodiment of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
might and mercy of a great Empire, as the durable impersonation
of the individual character that out of many welded
races creates a united Empire, it is manifestly operative. I
may add that it may also set an example of simplicity, for
the Crown is able to bring choice virtues into vulgar fashion.</p>

<p>Nor should sight be lost of the immense services which
the Sovereign may render to British interests abroad. Shifting
administrations encourage various hopes in foreign powers.
The Crimean War was an outcome of such renewed aspirations.
Our foreign policy lacks the strength of continuity,
and its changefulness seems ineradicable from our party
system. It is, therefore, of high importance that European
courts should be able to count on certain limits which they
know that a monarch whom they respect is likely to maintain.
Such a consciousness of finality enables foreign Governments
to moderate the popular clamour often worked up by dishonest
agitation, and the more obstinate because purposely
misinformed. The Crown can thus become a great conciliator,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>
and sometimes a preventer of actual war. The
affinities of the blood royal to continental dynasties are not
so cogent, though their material aid as sources of inner
information is manifest. But as guarantees of amity they
often prove comparatively helpless, unless supported by the
recognition of character, tact, and abilities, for which the
nurture of every British prince should fit him, and which
entitle him to appeal to every differing headship of peoples
abroad, as well as to the originally alien ingredients of empire
at home. The British Sovereign may well be called the
Member for the Empire.</p>

<p>On these aspects Disraeli often dwelt; and at a period
when, for these objects, the comparatively small expense was
affected to be grudged by a set of extreme politicians, his
analysis proved its cheapness in proportion to the cost of
large democracies and republics.</p>

<p>A great outcry was raised when, twenty-seven years ago,
Disraeli made the startling move of appealing alike to the
Hindoo and the Mohammedan sentiment by investing Queen
Victoria with a title which has impressed India with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
grandeur of Great Britain. To the Oriental the style of a
white queen meant as little as to the queen of the Ansaries, so
humorously depicted in <cite>Tancred</cite>. It was well said of Disraeli
by Lord Salisbury, in the speech which commemorated his
death, that zeal for the greatness of England had eaten him
up; and zeal, as Disraeli observed in an Irish speech of 1844,
is rare enough in these days. Never was a stroke more
justified by its results. Like the purchase of the Suez Canal
shares, equally justified, it was bitterly and blindly assailed.
“Bastard imperialism” was the refrain of the Opposition. No
one knew on what sacred ark the Machiavellian finger might
next be laid.</p>

<p>Disraeli proved that “empress” was an old ascription
even in England, and that “emperor” even in the Western
mind was not a title bound up with “bad associations.”
Macaulay had singled out the age of the Antonines as a
signal era for the world, and the Antonines had been
emperors. In the early ’sixties a definite and powerful party
had conspired to break the unity of the empire and the
dignity of the kingdom, to sacrifice everything to material
considerations, to convert <em>a first-class monarchy into a second-class
republic</em>. It was not enough that the national sentiment
should be diverted from appeals to pocket by appeals to
patriotism; that the gush of utilitarian cold water should be
arrested from drowning the rekindled flames of public spirit.
The coloured imagination of the East must also be brought
into line with the soberer background of the West. Nor was
the relation of the measure less weighty to Europe. Europe,
too, must realise that India was a trust which Britain was
resolute never to abandon. These objects Disraeli effected
by his “Royal Titles Bill,” a conception as simple as it was
daring. “They know in India,” he urged, after imploring the
House to “remove prejudice from their minds”—“they know
in India what this bill means, and they know that what it
means is what they wish.... Let not our divisions be
misconstrued. <em>Let the people of India feel that there is a
sympathetic chord between us and them, and do not let Europe
suppose for a moment that there are any in this House who are
not deeply conscious of the importance of our Indian Empire.</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Unfortunate words have been heard in the debate upon this
subject; but I will not believe that any member of this House
seriously contemplates the loss of our Indian Empire....
If you sanction the passing of this bill, it will be an act, to
my mind, that will add splendour even to her throne, and
security even to her Empire.” In a subsequent chapter I
shall show that these ideas of sympathy with India had
animated him while the great Mutiny was raging.</p>

<p>It was Disraeli who suggested to Queen Victoria the
propriety of learning the language and studying the literature
of the vast domain over which she ruled, and the <em>munshis</em>
summoned to instruct her, brought home to every Indian the
conviction that her sway was one, not only of strength, but of
sympathy and intelligence. Doubtless these policies were
born of dreams, and of dreams which to the unreflecting
might seem extravaganzas. But they were not merely an
Arabian Nights’ entertainment. The Monarchy, like the
Church, in his mind were in one respect akin. The Clergy
and the King were both “English citizens and English
gentlemen,” and yet the undue political influence of either, as
he insisted in 1861, was to be feared, because it might diminish
their best influence. Both make for order, and order makes
for liberty. “... It is said sometimes that the Church of
England is hostile to religious liberty. As well might it be
said that the Monarchy of England is adverse to political
freedom.”</p>

<p>Many of Disraeli’s central ideas as to British kingship
were partly decided by him from his boyish conversance with
the works of Lord Bolingbroke, whose constitutional theories
(repeated by Burke) solved the difficulty of accounting for the
popularity of exclusiveness in the theory of government, and
for the odiousness of that party which had once been inclusive
and “national.” Prerogative has been nowhere better defined
than by Bolingbroke, who uniformly also declares that Parliament
is the main barrier against “the usurpation of its
illegal, or the abuse of its legal, powers.” He terms prerogative
“a discretionary power in the King to act for the good
of his people where the laws are silent; ... never contrary
to law;” and this in a passage where he protests against its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
being raised “one step higher;” and he has further shown
elsewhere how some such “barefaced, extraordinary powers”
<em>were</em> welcomed by the nation in Elizabeth’s reign, because
they were called forth by popular emergencies and used
in a popular manner. Elizabeth, at a time before the
Sovereign depended on Parliament, and before the Cabinet
system was established, owed her power to her sympathy
with her people. The first two Georges were unsympathetic,
and the second abetted not only partisanship, but
cliqueship. He became dependent on contending heads
of greedy factions. To cure these evils was the purport of
the “Patriot King,” which inspired Disraeli as it had before
inspired Chatham.</p>

<p>It has been objected that Bolingbroke’s aim was for the
King to “defy Parliament.” Nothing could be further from
the truth. Throughout his writings he champions the rights
of Parliament; indeed, Parliament was his hobby. In his
treatise on the “Patriot King,” the word “Parliament” is not
employed—it is his only essay from which it is absent—but
the phrase “the people,” that is, has been expressly defined by
him as the whole nation in its capacities, representative as well
as collective. It therefore includes “Parliament.” In Bolingbroke’s
previous “Spirit of Patriotism,” he had approached
the theme of national regeneration from the standpoint of the
ideal citizen; in the “Patriot King,” from the standpoint of
a throne in accord with national concurrence. Its whole pith
is that the ideal King, governing through ministers and
through party, should rise above and beyond them. He must
be neither a partisan (as all the Georges proved), nor a
puppet, nor (as Canning long afterwards repeated) “the tool
of a confederacy,” but in alliance with and reliance on the
whole body of his subjects. The “Patriot King” is expressly
urged “to confine instead of labouring to extend his prerogative;”
and Bolingbroke adds that such an ideal would be
derided by his own generation.</p>

<p>Of Elizabeth herself, whose great example is his perpetual
praise, he has observed elsewhere that, “instead of struggling
through trouble and danger to bend the constitution to any
particular views of her own, she accommodated her notions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
her views, and her whole character to it;” and he proceeds to
say, “a free people expects this of their prince. He is made
for their sakes, not they for his;” and again, “the merit of a
wise governor is wisely to superintend the whole.” He
expresses his ideal of an impartial and democratic King in
his “Spirit of Patriotism” as of one who should “<em>govern all
by all</em>.” He further, in many direct passages, distinctly looks
forward to a transference of power from caballing cliques led
by selfish ambition, to the nation at large, and he calls on the
King to be a truly national ruler. He desires, under changes,
descried in the dim distance, that the “<em>sense of the Court, the
sense of the Parliament, and the sense of the People should be
the same</em>;” that the King, as he expresses it, should prove the
“centre of the nation,” and, as Disraeli has expressed it,
should be above “class interests;” should, in a country of
classes, respond to every class, and favouritise none. To
this end he harped, as did Disraeli from first to last, on
what he admits to be a seeming solecism—a “National
Party;” and by this he means—as I could prove by countless
passages—a party whose main object is <em>national and imperial
unity</em>; one that is, moreover, comprehensive instead of being
exclusive.</p>

<p>These ideas, in happier times and altered circumstances,
passed to Disraeli. In 1859, repeating in part what he had
affirmed of “Bolingbroke” in the Letter to Lord Lyndhurst,
indited nearly twenty-five years earlier, he said of the
Conservative party: “... In attempting, however humbly, to
regulate its fortunes, I have always striven to distinguish that
which was eternal from that which was but accidental in its
opinions. I have always striven to assist in building it upon
a <em>broad and national</em> basis, because I believed it to be a party
peculiarly and essentially <em>national</em>—a party which adhered to
the institutions of the country as embodying the national
necessities and forming the best security for the liberty, the
power, and the prosperity of England.”</p>

<p>In his Runnymede Letter to Peel of 1836, he calls on him
to head this “national party.” In his Crystal Palace oration
of 1872, he showed that the ideal of a “Conservative” party
seeking to preserve, adapt, and expand traditional institutions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
is to be national. In this striking speech, after deprecating
that, in the days of Eldon, “... instead of the principles
professed by Mr. Pitt and Lord Grenville, and which those
great men inherited ‘from predecessors’ not less illustrious,
the Tory system had degenerated into a policy which formed
an adequate basis on the principles of exclusiveness and
restriction,” he urged, as he had always urged: “... The
Tory party, unless it is a national party, is nothing. It is not
a confederacy of nobles, it is not a democratic multitude; it
is a party formed from all the numerous classes in the realm—classes
alike and equal before the law, but whose different
conditions and different aims give vigour and variety to our
national life.”</p>

<p>For the essence of these ideas, the forms which have since
appeared or vanished—the development of the ministerial
system, the organisation of public opinion—are immaterial.
Of course Bolingbroke could not foresee the <em>routine</em> of the far
future; it was its <em>spirit</em> which he foresaw, and to which,
through Disraeli, he contributed. In his own language about
another, he “... <em>had the wisdom to discern, not only the actual
alteration which was already made, but the growing alteration
which would every day increase</em>.” And this, too, may be
affirmed of Disraeli.</p>

<p>I think that, in the denial of Bolingbroke’s real objects,
achieved by Disraeli, some misconception has arisen from the
constant use towards the close of the eighteenth century of
“to govern by party connections.”</p>

<p>George III., a student of Bolingbroke, but a narrow abuser
on his first trial of his doctrine, was accused of meaning to
dispense with this watchword of oligarchs. But the quarrels
of his time proved that what George III. really wanted was to
dispense with one party alone, to escape from the dictation of
a few governing families, and to choose his own ministers.
There may be—there have been—great parties based on
principles of disruption and contraction rather than of union
and expansion, or parties based on principles more international
or continental than national and British. A “national” party
does not exclude their existence and criticism, any more than
it does that of another “national” party taking another outlook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
on “general principles.” What it ought more and more to
exclude, what the monarch as the centre of union should
more and more render impossible, is an anti-national group,
and the remedy that Burke suggests for such an ailment is
that propounded by Bolingbroke and upheld by Disraeli—the
limited and constitutional prerogatives of the Crown—which
should render less possible those gangs of office-mongers
who, in Bolingbroke’s phrase, pay “a private court at the
public expense,” and in Disraeli’s, are “public traders of easy
virtue.”</p>

<p>These ideas, shared by Bolingbroke, by Burke, by Canning,
and by Disraeli, are no tiresome theories, but lively and
practical issues. We too must look ahead. How far under
modern conditions, and apart from the spasms and clamours
of party, can the sovereign power as a force consolidating
the Empire be strengthened, and the royal prerogatives
wisely displayed in the light of day? Ought a King’s
personality to prove also the means of his power? Time
will show.</p>

<span class="subhead">COLONIES—EMPIRE—FOREIGN POLICY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Before</span> Disraeli had entered public life, at a time
when public opinion remained stagnant regarding the
reciprocal needs and splendid future of the Mother
Country and her children, while it was still thought
optional whether the parent supported the offspring or the
offspring the parent, Disraeli had pondered on the problem,
and brought imagination to bear upon it. The colonies were
not merely commercial acquisitions, they were the free vents
for the surplus energy of a great race, and the nursery gardens
of national institutions.</p>

<p>In <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite> he thus muses, dreaming of things
to come, in sight of <span class="locked">Corcyra—</span></p>

<p>“... There is a great difference between ancient and
modern colonies. A modern colony is a commercial enterprise,
an ancient colony was a political sentiment. In the
emigration of our citizens, hitherto, <em>we have merely sought
the means of acquiring wealth</em>; the ancients, when their
brethren quitted their native shores, wept and sacrificed, and
were reconciled to the loss of their fellow-citizens solely by
the constraint of stern necessity, and the hope that they were
about to find easier subsistence, and to lead a more cheerful
and commodious life. <em>I believe that a great revolution is at
hand in our system of colonisation, and that Europe will soon
recur to the principles of the ancient polity.</em>” In 1836 he thus
satirises the impending King’s speech in his Runnymede
Letter to Lord <span class="locked">Melbourne—</span></p>

<p>“... It will announce to us that in our colonial empire
the most important results may speedily be anticipated from
the discreet selection of Lord Auckland as a successor to our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Clives and our Hastings; that the progressive improvement of
the French in the manufacture of beetroot may compensate
for the approaching destruction of our West Indian plantations;<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
and that, although Canada is not yet independent,
the final triumph of liberal principles, under the immediate
patronage of the Government, may eventually console us for
the loss of the glory of Chatham and the conquests of Wolfe.”</p>

<p>Once in the House of Commons, he never ceased to urge
the claims of sentiment and the bonds of interest, while he
enforced the necessity for cementing them by federation and
by tariffs. In 1848, when Lord Palmerston, with his “perfumed
cane,” was dictating a constitution to Narvaez, Disraeli,
who on principle deprecated interference with foreign powers
unless British interests were endangered, here supported him,
just because he considered it a case with contingencies affecting
our colonial welfare and our own prestige. It was in
1848, too, that, descanting on the narrowing aspects of the
Manchester School, and their “unblushing” advocacy of the
“interests of capital,” he indicted their “colonial reform with
ruining the colonies.” It was in the same year that he taxed
the self-righteous Peelites with “turning up their noses at East
India cotton as at everything else Colonial and Imperial.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>Under Governments, of which Disraeli was the leading
spirit, a constitution was framed for New Zealand in 1852,
and in the summer of 1858 the colony of British Columbia
was established. It was not more than a few months afterwards
that disturbances arose; and the <cite>Times</cite>, in its review
of the year 1859, found in these elements only the “incubus”
of ubiquitous colonies and commerce. To this standing snarl
about “the millstone of the colonies and India” Disraeli
adverted thirteen years afterwards, when he said: “... It
has been shown with precise, with mathematical demonstration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
that there never was a jewel in the Crown of England that
was so truly costly.... How often has it been suggested
that we should emancipate ourselves from this incubus!” It
was Disraeli’s Government that in the ’sixties was to confederate
Canada, and in the ’seventies to devise a scheme for
confederating South Africa. In his earliest pamphlets Disraeli
had announced that the genius of the age was one of a
transition from the “feodal” to the “federal.” In his whole
outlook throughout he sought to reconcile the higher spirit
of the one with the material interests of the other. And yet,
astounding to relate, it was stated in a speech some seven
years or so ago, that Disraeli himself had endorsed such
melancholy and shortsighted pettiness. The sole foundation
that I have been able to find is a stray sentence in a light
letter to Lord Malmesbury; just as in 1863 he made merry
in Parliament over those who regarded the “colonial empire”
as an “annual burden.”</p>

<p>This sentence, jesting of the “millstone,” but sighing over
the chance of severance, was penned in 1853—the very year
after the New Zealand Constitution. It was a time of
despondency, following on fourteen years of colonial crisis.
During it both Canada and the Cape had rebelled. The
former’s Constitution had been suspended. The repeal of the
Sugar Duties had estranged mutinous Jamaica. Peel had been
constrained to exclaim that in “Every one of our colonies we
have another Ireland,” and Peel was an imperialist. In a
raw state, and in the crudity of earlier hardships, the colonies
always clash more readily with home government than when
the mellowing progress of experience enables them to take
a less partial view, and to accept help in working out their
own salvation. Moreover, the choice still lay between pure
democracy and democracy monarchical and national. The
democratic idea during this period was working in absolute
detachment from the ancient institutions which should have
been easily transplanted. In the colonies these were all in
danger. It was difficult here to find a rallying centre for
them there, and that difficulty was heightened by the two
new schools of Radical thought—the older, that of the philosophical
Molesworth and the utilitarian Hume, who tested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
policy by the criterion of immediate success; the newer, that
of the dry “Physical Equalitarians” of Manchester, which
regarded Great Britain as a huge co-operative store. Disraeli
from first to last urged the especial need in England for strong
as well as good government. The faculties for government
were being lessened and weakened. It was not one side only
that despaired; Lord John Russell himself had no faith in
the bare democracy of the colonial feeling. And yet we
have seen what Disraeli wrote of Lord John in <cite>The Press</cite>
at this very period. The home example then was unpropitious
for the colonies. Monarchy was yet far from
popular. What Disraeli feared in England—what may
still be dreaded in our midst—was the possible reaction—in
the face of limited employment of labour and growing
tyranny of capital—from detached democracy to moneyed
despotism. “Nor is there”—wrote Disraeli, with premature
penetration, in <cite>The Press</cite> of March 21, 1853—“a
country in the world in which the reaction from democracy
to despotism would be so sudden and so complete as in
England, because in no other country is there the same
timidity of capital; and just in proportion as democratic
progress by levelling the influences of birth elevates the
influences of money, does it create a power that would at
any time annihilate liberty—if liberty were brought into
opposition with the three-per-cents.” The effects of this
fermenting leaven both in England and among her colonies
had to be weighed; and Disraeli many years afterwards
avowed in a speech that for a moment he too had wavered.
That moment was the one of this passing phrase. But it stood
for a phase as momentary. Disraeli, like Strepsiades in the
Attic burlesque, had only “mislaid his cloak, not lost it.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
Ten years later he could advocate our colonial empire with
effect and authority. The colonies had become—as the
Crown had become—a popular institution, and a requisite
for the fresh air, fresh vents, and fresh health of an expanding
population cramped by now overcrowded towns. They might
still prove a recruiting ground for labour. Peel’s adoption of
the “physical happiness” principle, which postulates unlimited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
employment of industry, had not settled that problem by his
“liberation of commerce.” And, as Disraeli pointed out in
1873, if it were only to be settled by natural forces, the
“unlimited employment” of labour made for the erasement
of the national idea. To the theoretic Radical, however, the
colonies, like all our institutions, were still obstacles. “... To
him the colonial empire is only an annual burden. To him
corporation is an equivalent term for monopoly, and endowment
for privilege....”</p>

<p>Together with Disraeli’s name, in the mention of early
colonial aspirations, that of the then Sir E. Bulwer Lytton
should assuredly be commemorated. He, too, treated colonial
concerns, during his brief period of secretaryship, with firmness,
insight, and adroitness. Nor should it be forgotten that
between the two was a link of romantic imagination as well
as of long-standing friendship. Years before, they had both
contributed to the <cite>New Monthly Magazine</cite>. Both were men
of striking originality, untempered by a public school education;
and it is amusing to note that the fantastic strain,
enabling both to view the prospect spaciously, and censured
as “un-English”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> in Disraeli—often when he was really quoting
from our classics<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>—was only criticised as “extravagant”
in Lytton, or, at a later period, as “ornate” in Lord Leighton.
Both were students and interpreters of Bolingbroke. They
had each the faculty of regarding history as a whole, and from
a high vantage-ground, instead of perverting their vision of
progress by the paltry rancours of the moment. Such an
instinct is invaluable in attaching new settlements to the nest
of their nurture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
In 1863, summarising the aspirations of Conservatism, he
spoke of “our colonial empire, <em>which is the national estate</em>,
that assures to every subject, ... as it were, a freehold, and
which gives to the energies and abilities of Englishmen an
inexhaustible theatre.” He was swift to discern the bearing
of crucial alterations in America on the colonies. In 1864,
while the civil conflict was raging in the United States, he
urged, regarding them: “... What is the position of the
colonies and dependencies of her Majesty in that country?
Four years ago, when the struggle broke out, there was very
little in common between them. <em>The tie that bound them to
this country was almost one of formality</em>; but what has been
the consequence of this great change in North America? You
have now a powerful federation <em>with the element of nationality
strongly evinced in it</em>. They count their population by millions,
and they are conscious that they have a district more fertile
and an extent of territory equal to the unappropriated reserves
of the United States. <em>These are the elements and prognostics
of new influences</em> that have changed the character of that
country. Nor is it without reason that they do not feel less
of the ambition which characterises new communities than
the United States, and that they may become, we will say,
the ‘<em>Russia of the New World</em>.’... If from considerations
of expense we were to quit the possessions that we now occupy
in North America, it would be ultimately, as regards our
resources and wealth, as fatal a step as could possibly be
taken. Our prosperity would not long remain a consolation,
<em>and we might then prepare for the invasion of our country and
the subjection of the people</em>.” And he next insisted on the need
of Canada’s adequate defence, saying that while we would
not force our connection on any dependency, yet, finding our
colonies now asserting the principle of their nationality, “...
and ... foreseeing a glorious future, ... still depending on
the faithful and affectionate assistance of England, it would
be the most short-sighted and suicidal policy to shrink from
the duty that Providence has called upon us to fulfil.” In
1866, again, he advocated colonial interests in Parliament,
and, by a fine phrase, warned us to “... recollect that England
is the <em>metropolis of a colonial empire</em>; that she is at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
head of a vast number of colonies, the majority of which are
yearly increasing in wealth; and that every year these colonies
send back to these shores their capital and their intelligence in
the persons of distinguished men, who are naturally anxious that
<em>these interests should be represented in the House of Commons</em>.”</p>

<p>But it was in 1872 that Disraeli first propounded a
colonial policy which was the sum of many previous pronouncements,
and is even now being pondered, and not by
one party alone. He recognised that a united empire implies
a united nation; that, as he always maintained, Parliament
represents national opinion, and that colonial opinion and
sentiment at last formed part of it.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” urged Disraeli, “there is another and second
great object of the Tory party. If the first is to maintain the
institutions of the country, the second is, in my opinion, to
uphold the empire of England. If you look to the history of
this country since the advent of Liberalism—forty years ago—you
will find that there has been no effort, so continuous, so
subtle, supported by so much energy, and carried on with so
much ability and acumen, as the attempts of Liberalism
<em>to effect the disintegration of the empire of England</em>. Statesmen
of the highest character, writers of the most distinguished
ability, the most organised and efficient means have been
employed in this endeavour. It has been proved to all of us
that we have lost money by our colonies.” Alluding next to
the “incubus” in the passage I have already cited, he thus
frankly continues: ... “Well, that result was nearly accomplished
when these subtle views were adopted by the country,
under the plausible plea of granting self-government to the
colonies. I confess that I myself thought that the tie was
broken. Not that I, for one, object to self-government. I
cannot conceive how our distant colonies can have their
affairs administered except by self-government. But self-government,
in my opinion, ought to have been conceded, <em>as
part of a great policy of imperial consolidation. It ought to
have been accompanied by an imperial tariff, by securities for the
people of England for the enjoyment of the unappropriated lands
which belonged to the sovereign as their trustee, and by a
military code which should have precisely defined the means and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the responsibilities by which the colonies should be defended,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
and by which, if necessary, the country should call for aid from
the colonies themselves.</em> It ought further to have been accompanied
<em>by the institution of some representative council in the
metropolis, which would have brought the colonies into constant
and continuous relations with the home Government</em>. All this,
however, was omitted because those who advised that policy—and
I believe their convictions were sincere—looked upon the
colonies of England, looked even upon our connection with
India, as a burden upon this country, <em>viewing everything in a
financial aspect, and totally passing by those moral and political
considerations which make nations great, and by the influence of
which alone men are distinguished from animals</em>.”</p>

<p>Here we have a foreseeing and a far-seeing policy. Not
a point of this forecast but has engaged, or will soon engage,
national attention. With what courage and sagacity did
Disraeli hand on the torch of Bolingbroke, who, first of English
statesmen, had emphasised the significance of Gibraltar, who
foretold England’s mission as “a Mediterranean power,”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and
pictured her then scanty colonies as so many “home farms”!
None can now doubt the sagacity; and if any doubt the
courage, they have only to peruse the warnings of that
commercial Cassandra, Mr. Bright, who, during the manufactured
reaction of 1879, unconsciously justified Disraeli’s
predictions of seven years before. After cataloguing his
“annexations” like an auctioneer, he thus proceeded to stir
passion and impute <span class="locked">motives—</span></p>

<p>“... All this adds to your burdens. Just listen to this:
they add to the burdens, not of the empire, but of the
33,000,000 of people who inhabit Great Britain and Ireland.
We take the burden and pay the charge. This policy may
lend a seeming glory to the Crown, and it may give scope
for patronage and promotion, and pay a pension to a limited
and favoured class. But to you, the people, it brings expenditure
of blood and treasure, increased debts and taxes, and
adds risk of war in every part of the globe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Is sense more conspicuous than charity in this onslaught?
Has it not been proved penny wise, pound foolish? Could a
better instance be adduced of a contrast between England
as an emporium and Great Britain as a united empire?<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>
In many respects I honour Mr. Bright. He at least had the
courage of his honest convictions. He was against war
altogether; but in being so he opposed the instincts of rising
nationalities and tried to lull Great Britain into a fool’s
paradise of international exhibitions. It is now asserted that
Russia could not advance through Persia to India without a
bristling series of bayonets. This is not to be wished, but is
it to be feared? Of “Peace at any price,” Disraeli said with
truth—and truth in the interests of general peace—that it was
a “dangerous doctrine, which had done more mischief and
caused more wars than the most ruthless conquerors.” What
happened? Mr. Bright at a bound converted Mr. Gladstone.
It was a mutual necessity. Neither of them without the
other could have swayed the commercial classes and “the
lower middles.” Mr. Gladstone was Don Quixote; Mr. Bright,
Sancho Panza. Mr. Gladstone appealed to the nation; Mr.
Bright, with sincere power and definite ideals, to a class. Mr.
Gladstone appealed to the customs and institutions which he
heroically assailed; Mr. Bright attacked more directly and
without even the show of sympathy. Here Mr. Gladstone
was Girondin; Mr. Bright, Jacobin. Mr. Gladstone’s conviction
of being “the legate of the skies,” his electric temperament,
devout genius, practical fervour and “connection,” both idealised
and popularised the doggedness and the narrowness of Mr.
Bright’s democratic doctrine. But Mr. Bright was consistent.
He was against any fight for united nationality. He would
never have embarked on war at all, and so could never have
withdrawn from struggle at the wrong moment. He never
deluded himself or others. It might be said that the author of
the essay on “Church and State” led the “Nonconformist conscience”
to the altar, and that the eloquent denouncer both
of Church and State gave the bride away. But the chivalrous
knight-errant could not quite forego the Dulcinea of his youth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
It will be remembered that Mr. Gladstone, still by inadvertence,
used occasionally to stumble upon the word “empire” in his
speeches. Peel himself had called it “wonderful”! Lord
John Russell had employed it in 1855. It was a word born
with Queen Elizabeth, and familiar throughout the reign of
Queen Anne. Chatham’s clarion rang with it. The poet
Cowper, whom none can accuse of egotism or of bombast,
repeats it with a glow of pride. But Mr. Bright, unless I mistake,
never condescended to breathe the name or condone the
thing. Mr. Gladstone regained power, and ran riot—the riot of
the best intentions in the worst sense of the phrase. The
policy of “scuttle” ensued—from what motives I stop not here
to inquire. We abandoned Kandahar, “annexed” through a
need caused by past vacillations and repulses of the Ameer;
but, together with conditions for rendering him independent of
Russia’s natural intrigues. We abandoned it just when the
disasters of the Soudan again invited Russian encroachment.
We abandoned the Transvaal at the first blush of defeat.
“Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform” culminated in war, extravagance,
and confusion. The trumpeters of impolitic economy,
proposing expenditure and yet dangling the repeal of some
tax to gratify “the interests or prejudices of the party of
retrenchment,” were, in Disraeli’s phrase of 1861, “penurious
prodigals.” Upright “prigs and pedants,” intruding private
opinions on public affairs, honest hypocrites who deceived
themselves and hoped to persuade the sceptics of the world,
preachers of theories to the winds, all played with crucial issues
and trifled solemnly with a cynical Continent. The school-master
was abroad. We took Egypt against our will, and
promised not to retain it. We cried, “Hands off, Austria!”
and apologised for doing so. We prepared for necessitating
the most exceptional war of modern times. It was the policy
of panic and disunion, the policy of alternate weakness and
bluster, the policy that by turns coaxed and coerced Ireland,
allured and abandoned Gordon; it was a policy of private
magnanimity at the public expense, and not the policy of
wise consolidation and calculated outlets. It was not the
policy of diplomacies at once instructed, firm, and gentle. Nor
was it one of defined spheres, regulated boundaries, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
fortified “gates of empire.” Yet it led us to “expenditure of
blood and treasure.” And if we have since—and not, as I
believe, in the spirit or with the precautions of Disraeli—been
forced to retrace our steps, it is due to these retail
maxims of Mr. Bright, and not to the wholesale creed of Lord
Beaconsfield.</p>

<p>But the temper of his “Imperialism,” whatever may have
been momentarily suspected or sneered at, was never aggressive,
and always deliberate. It was for defence, not defiance;
it was no grandiose illusion, no gaudy show of spurious glory;
no froth or fuss of sound and fury signifying nothing.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>But the well-ripened fruit of wise delay.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It ran utterly counter, as he declared in 1862, to “that turbulent
diplomacy which distracts the mind of a people from internal
improvement.” Just as internally his statesmanship guarded
against the predominance of any particular class, so externally
the only ground for British intervention was for him the
undue predominance of a particular power against English
or the general interests. Throughout he sought what Lord
Castlereagh had also attempted, the solidarity of Europe. No
doubt, like all great men of action, he made mistakes and
committed errors. He owned as much himself. But I believe
that history will justify the height from which he surveyed
the scene, his reach and sweep of vision, the depth,
too, of an insight piercing far below the surface. In one
respect at least he may be said to have resembled Napoleon—“his
vast and fantastic conception of policy.” I do not
deny that he wished to strike the imagination; I do not deny
that occasionally the direct response may have missed fire;
but I submit that on the whole his policy was right, that
its final effects rarely disappointed intention, and that it has
left pregnant and abiding results. His aim was what the
late Lord Salisbury afterwards declared as his own, to “resume
the thread of our ancient empire;” and, as Macaulay has
remarked of George Savile, Marquis of Halifax, who was also
twitted with inconsistency: “... Through a long public life,
and through frequent and violent changes of public feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
he almost invariably took that view of the great questions of
his time which history has finally adopted.” At home on
leading issues he had strengthened the power of Government
by representing worthy opinion, and by renewing the affection
of the people for their institutions in the struggle to maintain
united English nationality against disruptive forces. It was
reserved for him to reawaken the slumbering sense of what
had once been an arousing reality—the <em>duties</em> of an august
empire over many associated races and religions, the due
greatness of Great Britain, the high destinies and ennobling
burdens of an ancient nation appointed to rule the seas.</p>

<p>The keynote was sounded in that very speech of 1862,
when he repeated what he had often before objected to the
robust Lord Palmerston’s frequently flustering methods, but
added that “... we should be vigilant to guard and prompt
to vindicate the honour of the country.” On an earlier
occasion, he laid stress on the diplomatic duty of “... if
necessary, saying rough things kindly, and not kind things
roughly;” while from first to last, however, as head of opposition,
he disapproved a foreign policy which landed us in
superfluous engagements, he always supported the Government
when the crisis became really national. In 1864, criticising
the Palmerstonian management of the Danish imbroglio,
he remarked: “... I am not for war. I can contemplate
with difficulty the combination of circumstances which can
justify war in the present age <em>unless the honour of the country
is likely to suffer</em>.”</p>

<p>Two more of his ruling principles were, first, that the
ripe moment is half the battle in national attitude towards
distant complications; and second, the importance, under our
system, of distinguishing between what a minister, backed
by a large parliamentary majority, decides in home and
in foreign affairs. His prescient criticisms on both the
source and the course of the Crimean War illustrate the
one; his deliverance, in a speech of May, 1855—a speech
prescribing a most statesmanlike policy towards both Russia
and Turkey, part only of which<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> he was able more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
twenty years later to execute, the other: “... A minister
may, by the aid of a parliamentary majority, support
unjust laws, and ... a political system which a quarter of a
century afterwards may, by the aid of another parliamentary
majority, be condemned. The passions, the prejudices, and
the party spirit that flourish in a free country may support
and uphold him.... But when you come to foreign politics
things are very different. Every step that you take is an
irretrievable one.... You cannot rescind your policy....
If you make a mistake in foreign affairs; if you enter into
unwise treaties; ... if the scope and tendency of your
foreign system are founded on a want of information or false
information, ... there is no majority in the House of
Commons which can long uphold a Government under such
circumstances. It will not make a Government strong, but
it will make this House weak....”</p>

<p>Throughout, his policy was that of confederation, not
annexation; of “scientific frontiers” safeguarding ascertained
“spheres of influence;” of binding, not loosing; of a strong
front but a soft mien; of persuasion, if possible, rather than
compulsion—as he always recommended in framing measures
to protect labour and improve society; of a straight line
steadfastly pursued, instead of wobble, worry, and flurry;
first beating the air, and then—a retreat; at once headstrong
and weak-kneed. Although his “Imperialism” was by no
means that which has occasionally since usurped the name,
assuredly, in upholding the burden of Great Britain’s destiny,
he would never have recoiled from “the too vast orb of her
fate.” Disraeli’s imperialism was not the bastard and braggart
sort that he once styled “rowdy rhetoric;” nor the official sort
to which he sarcastically alluded when Lord Palmerston, in
1855, took credit for accepting Lord John Russell’s resignation,
and was “ready to stand or fall by him:” “The noble Lord
is neither standing nor falling, but, on the contrary, he has
remained sitting on the Treasury bench.” Associated with
it, lay a deep sense of obligation in the choice of high character,
ability, and spirit to carry it out; the sense too that a momentary
mistake should never sacrifice excellent proconsuls to
the “hare-brained chatter of irresponsible frivolity;” the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
resolve also never to shirk responsibility by making scapegoats.
And, beyond all, a feeling that in dealing even with
semi-barbarous nations, it was neither magnanimous, wise,
nor dignified to crush them utterly, and that their feelings,
prejudices, and customs ought to be respected.</p>

<p>Perhaps no better example could be given than his attitude
regarding the events of 1879 in South Africa. The Zulus
had threatened and harassed an impoverished and resourceless
Transvaal. The Transvaal had requested and obtained
“annexation” from Great Britain. But the Zulu chief,
irritated by the suppression of the “suzerainty” arrogated
by him over the Boer lands, began to beset the Natal
borders. The Governor of Natal was for appeasing them.
Sir Bartle Frere, however, that commanding High Commissioner
of South Africa, took an opposite view, and favoured
a course unmistakable for weakness. In his conferences
with Cetchwayo he made requisitions, on his own initiative,
exceeding his instructions from home. The result was war,
with the disaster of Isandhlwana, the rally of Rorke’s Drift,
and eventual success. During March the matter was brought
before the House of Lords in a form arranged to censure the
Government policy, but so worded as to restrict the debate
to the advisability of Sir Bartle Frere’s recall on the ground
of his unauthorised ultimatum.</p>

<p>Disraeli’s speech is worthy of close attention, if only
because it forecasts the ultimate federation of South Africa.
Disraeli defended Sir Bartle on the score that to succeed
in impugning error, if error it was, of a distinguished public
servant chosen by the Crown, was to impugn its prerogative.
“<em>Great services are not cancelled by one act or one single error,
however it may be regretted at the moment.</em> If he had been
recalled ... in deference to the panic, the thoughtless panic
of the hour, in deference to those who have no responsibility
in the matter, and who have not weighed well and deeply
investigated all the circumstances and all the arguments ...
which ... must be appealed to to influence our opinions in
such questions—no doubt a certain degree of odium might
have been diverted from the heads of her Majesty’s ministers,
and the world would have been delighted, as it always is, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
find a victim.... We had only one course to pursue, ... to
take care that at this most critical period ... affairs ... in
South Africa should be directed by one, not only qualified to
direct them, but who was superior to any other individual
whom we could have selected for the purpose.”</p>

<p>It would be a bad precedent, he resumed, for the safety of
the empire if an exceptional indiscretion were to efface a long
record of signal ability; and he drew to the recollection of the
House<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> the case of Sir James Hudson at Turin, whose conduct
had been similarly attacked, and whom he, as the leader of the
Opposition, had refused to make a party question, and had
himself then defended on the same public considerations.
But adverting to policy, he used these weighty <span class="locked">words—</span></p>

<p>“... Sir Bartle Frere was selected by the noble Lord
(Carnarvon) ... chiefly to secure one great end—namely, <em>to
carry out that policy of</em> <span class="smcap smaller">CONFEDERATION</span> <em>in South Africa</em> which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
the noble Lord had carried out on a previous occasion with
regard to the North American colonies.</p>

<p>“If there is any policy which, in my mind, is opposed to
the policy of <em>annexation</em>, it is that of <em>confederation</em>. By pursuing
the policy of confederation, <em>we bind states together, we
consolidate their resources, and we enable them to establish a
strong frontier; that is the best security against annexation.
I myself regard a policy of annexation with great distrust. I
believe that the reasons of state which induced us to annex the
Transvaal were not, on the whole, perfectly sound.</em> But what
were these circumstances?... The Transvaal was a territory
which was no longer defended by its occupiers.... <em>The
annexation of that province was ... a geographical necessity.</em></p>

<p>“But the ‘annexation’ of the Transvaal was one of the
reasons why those who were connected with that province
might have calculated upon the permanent existence of Zululand
as an independent state. I know it is said that, when
we are at war, as we unfortunately now are, with the Zulus,
or any other savage nation, even though we inflicted upon
them some great disaster, and might effect an arrangement
with them of a peaceable character, before long the same
power would again attack us, unless we annexed the territory.
<em>I have never considered that a legitimate argument in
favour of annexation of a barbarous country....</em> Similar results
might occur in Europe if we went to war with one of our
neighbours.... <em>But is that an argument why we should not
hold our hand until we have completely crushed our adversary,
and is that any reason why we should pursue a policy of extermination
with regard to a barbarous nation with whom we
happen to be at war? That is a policy which I hope will never
be sanctioned by this House.</em></p>

<p>“It is, of course, possible that we may again be involved
in war with the Zulus; but it is an equal chance that in the
development of circumstances in that part of the world, the
Zulu people may have to invoke the aid and the alliance of
England against some other people, and that the policy
dictated by feelings and influence which have regulated our
conduct with regard to European states, may be successfully
pursued with regard to less civilised nations in a different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
part of the world. <em>This is the policy of her Majesty’s Government,
and therefore they cannot be in favour of a policy of
annexation, because it is directly opposed to it....</em>”</p>

<p>The same considerations, those of settled and settling
limits—considerations, let me repeat, directly opposed to a
vague and wavering policy fraught with encroachments,
alarm, and haphazard embroilment—were to actuate his
policy towards Afghanistan during 1879, into the vexed
details of which I shall not now enter, though they might
be reviewed with instruction; the policy, too, that recognised
that English vacillation would at once be magnified into
weakness throughout the bazaars of the Orient.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>The “insane annexation” of that fortress-citadel, Kandahar,
it has often been objected, was the most vulnerable
of Disraeli’s schemes. There are many entitled to
respect who still hold that it was rightly and profitably
rescinded. Moreover, the tragic sequel of the heroic Cavagnari’s
death prejudiced the public. But the chain of events
which required, the conciliatory conditions which accompanied
it, and the true causes, or pretexts, for its annulment with
virulence, should be carefully remembered. A former Viceroy’s
mistake in rebuffing the friendly overtures of the
Afghans, the Muscovite move forward in Central Asia, while
war was in the air, the consequent intrigues at Cabul, perturbed
by dynastic broils—these were some of the warrants for
its necessity. Fresh Russian manœuvres and advances, owing
to a fatally feeble policy in the Soudan, were parts of the
lever for its relinquishment. The highest military authorities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
sanctioned it at the time, though other high military authorities
disapproved a few years later. But when it is borne in mind
that Disraeli’s previous occupation of Quetta, the key both
to Kandahar and the Pishin valley, is now a large cantonment,
that a railway is ready to be laid to within no great
distance of Kandahar itself on any fresh emergency, it may
well be pondered whether Disraeli was mistaken, and whether
time has not confounded the triflers who caricatured him as a
music-hall singer, with the <span class="locked">refrain—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“I wear a jewel in my cap—<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Kandahar, Kandahar.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It was no mere question of a “buffer” state. It formed
a weighty part of his great and pacific project for safeguarding
the “gates” of our Indian Empire. Of the three main
approaches then open to Russia—entitled in her own
interests to use them, as he always admitted—the south-eastern
limits of Afghanistan command the long high-road
which leads to the distant north-western borders and the
“gate” of Herat. Moreover, they dominate one of the important
trade routes to Northern India. The remote side of
the Indus can thus be used as a protection against the remoter
side of the Oxus. At the same time, Disraeli subsidised the
Afghans, and when their Ameer, under Russian influence, insulted
our envoy, treated them at first “like spoiled children.”
His aim was—as always in his whole policy—a compact
independence. “<em>Both in the East and West</em>,” he observed,
“<em>our object is to have prosperous, happy, and contented neighbours</em>.
But these are things which cannot be done in a day.
You cannot settle them as you would pay a morning visit.”
He was building the foundations for a lasting peace. At
any rate, the rectified frontier, which as he pointed out could
be held by five thousand men, while a “haphazard” frontier
demanded twenty times that number, is unimpugned. Nor
should those who speak of a smoothed Ameer and an unruffled
Cabul, after Kandahar was evacuated, forget that, since
Merv has become Russian, the old dynastic intrigues and
tribe feuds may, one day, readily recur at Cabul, fresh opportunities
encourage Russia, and a reoccupation of this cancelled
coign of vantage become imperative. “The science of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
politics,” as Macaulay well says, “is an experimental science.”
Disraeli excelled most statesmen in his intuitive grasp of
Indian affairs. Peel himself, shortly before his death, prophesied
that Disraeli, “when his hour struck,” would be
“Governor-General of India.”</p>

<p>The same principles, as will appear, prompted the masterly
and masterful Treaty of Berlin. The same, caused him to
exclaim of Russia, whose designs he had thwarted in India
and foiled at Constantinople, in memorable language, that in
Asia there was “room enough” for her and for us; yet that,
though in the face of possible conflict, she was entitled to
equip her expedition of courtesy to “cool the hoofs of its
horses in the waters of the Oxus,” she must be induced to
withdraw it by our own counter-preventions. But what I
wish here particularly to illustrate is, the psychological point
of respect for and reckoning with the habits, wants, and traditions
of other or alien civilisations. It rested on an idea
familiar to his youth, and which he thus expressed in a soliloquy
of <cite>Alroy</cite>: “Universal empire must not be founded
on sectarian principles and exclusive rights.... Something
must be done to bind the conquered to our conquering
fortunes.”</p>

<p>It was signally evinced in his treatment—his exceptional
treatment when Opposition leader—of the Indian Mutiny.
At that time Disraeli alone seemed to grasp the significance
of the outbreak in its initial stage, which was viewed as
a mere military rebellion, and regarded as lightly, and with
as little reason, as the beginnings of the Boer War.</p>

<p>“It is remarkable,” he urged, before the crisis became
recognised, “how insignificant incidents at the first blush have
appeared which have proved to be pregnant with momentous
consequences. A street riot in Boston and at Paris, turned
out to be the two great revolutions of modern times. Who
would have supposed when we first heard of the rude visit of a
Russian sailor from a port in the Black Sea to Constantinople,
that we were on the eve of a critical war and the solution
of the most difficult of modern problems?” It was, he contended,
a national revolt, not a military mutiny. In our
policy of the immediate past we had forcibly destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
native authority for the sole object of increasing revenue.
“In spite of the law of adoption, which was the very corner-stone
of Hindoo society, when a native prince died without
natural heirs, though a son had been adopted as a successor,
the Government of India annexed his dominions. Sattara,
Berar, Jeitpore, Sumbulpore, Jhansi, were monuments of
‘nefarious’ acquisition. And Oude, of ‘a wholesale system
of spoliation,’ for it had been annexed even without the
pretext of a lawful failure of heirs.”</p>

<p>We had also disturbed the settlement of property by “a
new system of government.” He analysed the popular law
of adoption as the basis of Hindoo property, and as contrasted
with its misuse in the hands of princes as a source of succession.
He gave many instances, distinguishing each. “What
man was safe, what feudatory, what freeholder who had not
a child of his own loins, was safe throughout India?... The
Government determined to exact all it could, not only from
princes, but from the people.” The exemptions from the land
tax—“the <em>whole</em> taxation of the State”—had, under pretences,
been continually taken away. The resumption of estates in
Bengal alone had yielded the Government half a million of
revenue; in Bombay alone £370,000 a year. Moreover,
hereditary pensions had been commuted into personal annuities.
These disturbances had naturally fomented these
discontents.</p>

<p>We had, moreover, tampered with the Hindoo religion.
“... I think a very great error exists as to the assumed
prejudice of Hindoos with regard to what is called missionary
enterprise. The fact is that ... the Indian population
generally, with the exception of the Mussulmans, are
educated in a manner which peculiarly disposes them to
theological inquiries.... They are a most ancient race;
they have a mass of tradition on these subjects; a complete
Indian education is to a great degree religious; their laws,
their tenure of land depend upon religion; and there is no
race in the world better armed at all points for theological
discussion.... Add to this, that they can always fall back
upon an educated priesthood prepared to supply them with
arguments and illustrations.... <em>But what the Hindoo does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
regard with suspicion is the union of missionary enterprise
with the political power of the Government.</em> With that power
he associates only one idea, violence.... It appears to me
that the legislative council of India has, under the new
principle, been constantly nibbling at the religious system of
the natives.” It had tried to adapt Western systems to
Oriental habits. In its theoretical system of national education
the “sacred Scriptures had suddenly appeared in the
schools; and you cannot persuade the Hindoos that those
holy books have appeared there without the concurrence and
the secret sanction of the Government.” Systematic female
education, again, had been commanded—a most unwise
step, considering “the peculiar ideas entertained by Hindoos
with regard to women.” But two acts had even more contributed
to the ferment of native feeling. The first, that no
man who changed his religion should be deprived of his
inheritance. That struck at the main purpose of property in
India, which consists in being a sacred trust for religious
objects. The second, that a Hindoo widow might marry
again, “which is looked upon by all as an outrage on their
faith,” uncalled for, and fraught with alarm.</p>

<p>But the main blunder had been the annexation of Oude
without excuse, and executed in such a manner that for the
first time the Mahometan princes felt that they had an
identity of interest with the Indian rajahs. “... You see
how the plot thickens.... Men of different races and different
religions ... traditionary feuds and long and enduring prejudices
with all the elements to produce segregation, become
united—Hindoos, Mahrattas, Mahommedans—secretly feeling
a common interest and a common cause.” Princes and proprietors
are against you. “Estates as well as musnuds are in
danger. You have an active society spread all over India,
alarming the ryot, the peasant, respecting his religious faith.
Never mind on this head what were your intentions; <em>the
question is, what were their thoughts—what their inferences</em>?”
And a further aggravation had resulted. The Oude sepoy,
who was a yeoman, had recruited the Bengal army. “Robbed
of his country and deprived of his privileges, he schemed
and plotted, and sent mysterious symbols from village to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
village, which prepared the native mind,” agitated by princes
deposed, religion insulted, soldiery discontented, for an
occasion and pretext “to overthrow the British yoke.” “<em>The
Mutiny was no more a sudden impulse, than the income tax
was a sudden impulse. It was the result of careful combinations,
vigilant and well-organised, on the watch for opportunity....</em>
I will not go into the question of the new cartridges.... I
do not suppose any one ... will believe that because the
cartridges were believed to be, or were pretended to be
believed to be, greased with pig’s or cow’s fat, that was the
cause of this insurrection. <em>The decline and fall of empires
are not affairs of greased cartridges. Such results are occasioned
by adequate causes and by an accumulation of adequate causes.</em>”</p>

<p>And now what remedies would meet such emergencies?
Force, it was agreed, must now be employed. The force
proposed was inadequate. “There should be an advance from
Calcutta through Bengal, and an expedition up the Indus.
The Militia should be called out. An Empire, not a Cabinet,
was in danger.”</p>

<p>“... But to my mind that is not all that we ought to
look to. Even if we do vindicate our authority with complete
success—revenge the insults that we have received, rebuild
the power that has been destroyed ... although we will
assert with the highest hand our authority, although we will
not rest until our unquestioned supremacy and predominance
are acknowledged, ... it is not merely as avengers that we
appear. <em>I think that the great body of the population of that
country ought to know that there is for them a future of hope.
I think we ought to temper justice with mercy—justice the most
severe with mercy the most indulgent....</em> Neither internal
nor external peace can in India,” he urged, “be secured by
British troops alone. <em>There must be no more annexation, no
more conquest....</em> It is totally impossible that you can
ever govern 150,000,000 of men in India by merely European
agency. You must meet that difficulty boldly and completely....
<em>You ought at once ... to tell the people of India that
the relation between them and their real ruler and sovereign,
Queen Victoria, shall be drawn nearer.</em> You must act upon
the opinion of India on that subject immediately; <em>and you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
can only act upon the opinion of Eastern nations through their
imagination</em>. You ought to have a Royal Commission sent by
the Queen from this country to India immediately, to inquire
into the grievances of the various classes of that population.
You ought to issue a royal proclamation to the people of
India, declaring that the Queen of England is not a sovereign
who will countenance the violation of treaties ... that she
... will respect their laws, their usages, their customs, and,
above all, their religion. <em>Do this, and do this not in a corner,
but in a mode and manner which will attract universal attention,
and excite the general hope of Hindostan in the Queen’s name
and with the Queen’s authority.</em> If that be done, simultaneously
with the arrival of your forces, you may depend upon it that
your military advance will be facilitated, and, I believe, your
ultimate success insured.”</p>

<p>I have abstracted this significant speech, which took three
hours to deliver, because it shows how his mind grasped such
situations, and how his imagination played all around them.
In the same way, in 1856, he deprecated the violent interference
of Sir J. Bowring (a former secretary of the Peace
Society) with the Chinese, and insisted that they were “the
nation of etiquette,” and were not to be coerced by “a brutal
freedom of manners.” “If you are not,” he then prophetically
protested, “cautious and careful of your conduct now in dealing
with China, you will find that you are likely not to extend
commerce, <em>but to excite the jealousy of powerful states, and to
involve yourselves in hostilities with nations not inferior to
yourselves</em>....”</p>

<p>Such were the ideas that prompted the stroke of the Suez
Canal shares, and his dramatic summoning of the Indian
troops to Malta when Russia was before the citadel of the
Levant, and India had to be impressed; that prompted, too,
his proclamation of the Queen as Empress of India; and
his choice of the late Lord Lytton as a poet suited for
Indian Viceroyalty; these ideas, that made him announce,
shortly before he died, that “London” was “the key of India.”</p>

<p>In this context I must dwell too for a moment on what I
have already hinted concerning the temper of his diplomacy.
Already, in 1860, he had recognised the full changes imposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
by the spirit of the age. “... In the old days,” he observed,
“diplomacy was conducted in a secret fashion, whilst now we
had ‘a candid foreign policy.’ What in former times ...
would have been a soliloquy in Downing Street, now becomes
a speech in the House of Commons.” But that was no
pretext, he also always asserted, as I shall again have to
notice, for roughness and offence, for a high voice and a low
hand; still less for playing censor, lecturer, or hector at
once. Above all, he abominated the diplomacy which
encourages by words and disappoints by deeds—the diplomacy
that in 1864 promised defence to Denmark and then denied
her even encouragement. Speaking then, Disraeli said:
“... We will not threaten, and then refuse to act; we will
not lure on our allies with expectations we do not mean to
fulfil. And, sir, <em>if ever it be the lot of myself or any public men
with whom I have the honour to act, to carry on important
negotiations on behalf of this country ... I trust that we at
least shall not carry them on in such a manner that it will be
our duty to come to Parliament to announce to the country that
we have no allies, and then declare that England can never act
alone</em>.” In diplomacy, moreover, he laid great stress—as is
witnessed by a striking passage in <cite>Endymion</cite>—on the need
for a minister’s personal acquaintance with the chief actors
on the foreign stage, and with the temper of the people
whose fortunes are in their hands.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>All these governing issues underlay his great Berlin
Treaty. Its first principle was to uphold the <em>effective</em> independence
of Turkey. Several absurdities have been alleged
on this head. It was also bruited for political ends that, as
a Semite,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> he fostered the Moslem, whom, as a Briton, he
should have suppressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
This is not only untrue, but inaccurate. It is the sort of
mistake adopted by such as imagine Mahomet to have been
a Turk. Disraeli had early in life travelled far into the East,
had been present at Yanina during an insurrection, had known
leading pachas (one of whom consulted him), and observed
inner intrigues. But while the Moslem soldier and peasant
always impressed him, he detested the system of the Sultan.
An early passage records this detestation. Pondering, in
<cite>Contarini Fleming</cite>, the failure of successive Governments to
rid Asia of “the revelations of the son of Abdallah,” he calls
its whole object one “to convert man into a fanatic slave.”
His two earlier romances, <cite>Alroy</cite> and <cite>Iskander</cite>, both glow with
this theme—rebellion against Islam. The picturesqueness,
both in scenery and history, of all Mediterranean countries,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>
fascinated him; so did the charm of the East, which, as a
stripling, he defined as “repose.” But it was the habitation
of the Turk, not the Turk, that exercised the spell. “Live
a little longer in these countries before you hazard an opinion
as to their conduct,” says one of his characters. “Do you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
indeed think that the rebel beys of Albania were so simple?...
The practice of politics in the East may be described by
one word, dissimulation....”</p>

<p>An adverse opinion also characterises his letters from
the East, some of which are embodied in his books. <cite>Alroy</cite>,
dedicated to Jerusalem, as <cite>Iskander</cite><a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> is to Athens, are neither
of them favourable to Turkey. And even the Turkish want
of humour annoyed him. “I never offered an opinion till
I was sixty,” says the old Turk in the last romance, “and
then it was one which had been in our family for a century.”
He detested fanatics as he detested bores, but he loved
purpose; and the sole thing that recommended the Turk to
him was that, though a fanatic and a bore, he was both for a
purpose. Moreover, up to 1840 the Greeks were more favourable
to the Jews than the Turks; and it can scarcely be
contended that his attitude to the Afghans—who are Semite
by race—was prejudiced by the fact. No; if we seek for
a Semitic affinity in Disraeli outside that to Israel, we must
find it in that to the Saracens of Spain.</p>

<p>But neither is the stricture of his principle valid. As
is well known, in upholding the independence of Turkey, he
was following in the steps of his predecessors and indorsing
the known views of two skilled diplomatists, Sir Robert
Morier and Sir Henry Layard, whose political tenets were
opposite to Disraeli’s. He had long before made up his
mind on this subject, had defined Turkey as a “barrier”
against aggression. In a speech towards the close of the
Crimean War—“the Coalition War”—a speech in which he
blamed the Government for their treatment of Russia, and
considered Russia’s “preponderance” towards Turkey, he
observed: “... I believe that there are elements, when
Turkey shall be more fairly treated—and never has any
country been more unfairly treated than Turkey, especially
within the last two years—for securing the independence of
her empire, and (what is to us of vital interest) preventing
Constantinople from becoming an appanage to any great
military power.”</p>

<p>By a tripartite treaty we, conjointly with Russia, Austria,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
and France, were allies bound to maintain the territorial
integrity of Turkey—that is, whatever dispositions might be
made, she must retain a compact and self-inclosed dominion.
And why had this become a necessity for England, which
is an Eastern as well as a Western power? There was a
double cause—our Indian Empire and our Mediterranean
trade; it was in the interest of both that a comparatively
weak power should occupy the very key of the position—an
historical capital whose very name symbolises empire,
and whose situation, facing both east and west, dominates
the Levant and commands the high-road of the Orient.
As between Greece and Russia, the first undoubtedly possesses
the claims of race and inheritance. The second is an
interloper, and her “Greekness” springs from ecclesiastical
and political usurpation. The Greek Macedonians are more
hostile to Russia than to Turkey. Before now the Greeks
have expressed their gratitude that Disraeli saved them from
being sucked into a huge Bulgaria. It was in the interest of
European peace that Constantinople should not be in the
hands of a power so small, so restive, so motley, so fluid as
Greece. It was in the interest of India that the Moslem
pope should be upheld. It was in the interest, moreover, of
the Christian subjects of the Porte themselves that Turkey
should be so tied and so pledged to the great military and
maritime powers in concert, that they could exact real
guarantees for their protection, should brutal misbehaviour
re-arise, and that the work of humanity should be left to none
of these powers apart, and exposed to the temptation of
indulging separate ambitions and disturbing the peace of the
world. If united selfishness has deterred them from doing
their duty, that must not be laid to the treaty’s charge.
“Those,” he said, in 1876, “who suppose that England ever
would uphold, or at this moment particularly is upholding,
Turkey from blind superstition and from a want of sympathy
with the highest aspirations of humanity, are deceived. What
our duty is at this critical moment is to maintain the Empire
of England;” and before the Congress, he again solemnly
pointed out that worse, more widespread, and far more lasting
agonies would be caused to myriads abroad if the misguided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
excitement of several sections at home were to prevail, than
even by any horrors which must move both indignation and
sympathy in every heart.</p>

<p>Into the detailed controversies of the “Bulgarian atrocities”
agitation I will not here enter. It is now generally confessed
that Disraeli was right not to be led away by the sensational
exaggerations manufactured for Russian purposes abroad, and
retailed, sometimes, for political purposes at home. Horrible
savageries, of course, happened on both sides in such a war,
and those horrors, from the nature of their theatre, were
Oriental. But that they were bound up with racial feuds,
and were in full evidence on the other side, was vouched
for to me—and in great detail—some ten years after their
occurrence, by Sir William White, then Ambassador at Constantinople,
and by the then consul, himself a leading member
of the committee for their investigation. These authorities
went much further in their declarations than ever Disraeli
did, with his extreme reticence in public. Indeed, they told
me that the whole source of the war had been engineered by
the acute irritations of Russian diplomacy, which, as Lord
Derby long ago expressed it, “has never proceeded by storm,
but by sap and mine.”</p>

<p>The true facts should not be blinked. With regard to
Turkey in Europe they are both racial, political, and ecclesiastical.
The race aspect was powerful with Disraeli. He
always believed it to be “the key of history, and the surest
clue to the characters of men in all ages.” In England he
discerned the blend of “Saxon industry and Norman manners.”
While it was race again that had made national institutions
“the ramparts of the multitude against large estates exercising
political power derived from a limited class.” Practically,
it is still a question of the Slav against both Greeks (whom
they have murdered) and Albanians, who themselves massacre
the Serbs. Politically, it is a question of Russian influence
and both Austrian and Italian jealousy. Ecclesiastically, it
is a question of the freed principalities against the Patriarch
of Constantinople; who, since the very time when Russia first
newly pretended to the Byzantine inheritance of the Greeks, became
(oddly enough) a nominee of the Sultan. From the outset<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Disraeli determined to undo that larger Bulgaria, stretching
to the Ægean, involving all the international conflicts just
hinted, and ranging from the Danube to Salonica, which
Russia proposed by the clandestine Treaty of San Stefano.
As is familiar, he founded a smaller Bulgaria, barriered by the
Balkans, dividing it into two portions—Bulgaria and Eastern
Roumelia—in the last of which he implanted autonomy. It
has often been said that the sequel proved him futile, for the
two slices of the big worm have since been repieced. But the
events of 1885–86 which caused this reunion were the gift, not
of Russian ascendency, but of those very institutions which
Disraeli created. Again, it has been popularly put as if the
treaty were not his own policy and had not endured. I could
most easily prove the error of both these propositions. As
regards the first, just as in the Reform Bill of 1867, the co-operation
of both parties was necessary for the limited achievement
of his views, so it fared with the need for European
concert in the Berlin Treaty. But his ideas had been sketched
out during the Crimean War, and the restoration of that very
concert, which still subsists, was a birth of the treaty. The
Berlin Treaty restored not only British prestige, but—as a
foreign statesman remarked—Britain’s moral influence in the
councils of Europe. It was so hailed in England, and this,
as Mr. Roebuck acknowledged, was its ground for enthusiastic
national support. Russia withdrew from Constantinople. Both
the Dardanelles and the Turkish frontier in Europe were
assured. A Sultan, then beset with bankruptcy and dynastic
troubles, was given his chance of heading a party of reform
championed by Midhat. Turkey was rendered compact, and
lopped of mongrel provinces, while she obtained the port of
Burgos on the Black Sea as a check to Russia. As regards
Turkey in Asia, Disraeli’s aim, as I have already outlined,
was Indian. Erzeroum, Bayazid, Alashkerd, proved powerful
buffers against Russian predominance; and Russia still sways
the mongrel Bessarabia then restored to her. It is now recognised
that Russia, to traverse Persia, would encounter a
British bayonet at every step. Disraeli’s great object, like
Palmerston’s, was to prevent Turkey from becoming a fief to
Russia, and the Black Sea from remaining a mere Russian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
lake, as the repudiation by Mr. Gladstone, in 1871, of the
clause in the Treaty of Paris, for which the Crimean War
had been resumed, subsequently empowered it to become.
Turkey, Disraeli had written in <cite>The Press</cite> of May 21, 1853,
was “a necessary evil in the European system,” but one preferable
to some others, and more likely to prevent general
anarchy and bloodshed. And he recalled Prince Potemkin’s
old inscription on the gates of Chusan: “This is the road to
Constantinople.” The standing danger was the interposal of
Russian ambition on the perpetual plea of a Christian protectorate—resented
by many of the Christian provinces themselves—in
order to constitute Turkey a Russian province, and
to spread a dominion less fanatical, perhaps, but even more
merciless and repressive in Europe, however civilising it has
proved in portions of Central Asia. His scheme, compassing
autonomy here, independence there, compactness, the power
to govern and the accountability to improve, everywhere was
one of development. It held within it, as he said, the seeds
of “Evolution.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>How did Disraeli diagnose Russia’s legitimate aspirations?
He certainly neither ignored nor condemned them, but he
distinguished between aspirations legitimate and illegitimate.
Speaking in 1871, after Russia had violated and Mr. Gladstone
had torn up the Black Sea Clause, Disraeli criticised
the course which the Ministry had pursued.</p>

<p>“... Russia has a policy, as every great power has a
policy, and she has as much right to have a policy as Germany
or England. I believe the policy of Russia, taking a general
view of it, to have been a legitimate policy, though it may
have been inevitably a disturbing policy. When you have a
great country in the centre of Europe, with an immense
territory, with a numerous and yet, as compared with its
colossal area, a sparse population, producing human food to
any extent, in addition to certain most valuable raw materials,
it is quite clear that a people so situated, practically without
any seaboard, would never rest until it had found its way to
the coast, and could have a mode of communicating easily
with other nations, and exchanging its products with them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Well, for two hundred years Russia has pursued that policy;
it has been <em>a legitimate though disturbing policy</em>. It has cost
Sweden provinces, and it has cost Turkey provinces. But
no wise statesman could help feeling that it was a legitimate
policy—a policy which it was impossible to resist, and one
which the general verdict of the world recognised—<em>that Russia
should find her way to the sea-coast</em>. She has completely
accomplished it. She has admirable seaports; she can communicate
with every part of the world, and she has profited
accordingly.</p>

<p>“<em>But at the end of the last century she advanced a new view.
It was not a national policy</em>; it was invented by the then ruler
of Russia—a woman, a stranger, and an usurper—<em>and that
policy was that she must have the capital of the Turkish Empire</em>.
That was not a legitimate, that was a disturbing policy. <em>It
was a policy like the French desire to have the Rhine—false in
principle.</em> She had no moral claim to Constantinople; <em>she
did not represent the races to which it once belonged</em>; she had
no political necessity to go there, <em>because she already had two
capitals</em>. Therefore it was not a legitimate but a disturbing
policy. <em>As the illegitimate desire of France to have the Rhine
has led to the prostration of France, so the illegitimate desire
of Russia to have Constantinople led to the prostration of
Russia....</em>”</p>

<p>The means used by Disraeli for preserving the peace of
Europe and protecting our Eastern Empire were, in the rough,
on the lines I have tried to shadow. First of all, refusing to
allow the creation of an unwieldy and anarchic province of
discordant races which could not become a coherent nation,
he reduced the Bulgaria designed under the San Stefano
arrangement by two-thirds, created Eastern Roumelia, with
a framed constitution, south of the Balkans, and yielded the
rest to Turkey. By this measure not only was Bulgaria
prevented from being bulky and hybrid, but the Macedonian
Greeks (preponderant over Slavs and Serbs) were saved from
absorption. Turkey was delimited in Europe by the natural
fastnesses of the Balkans—one that even in his youth Disraeli
marked as the real frontier. Turkey was pledged to reform
her administration, while the signatories also guaranteed her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
from Russian aggression. Both Russia and Turkey, therefore—and,
indeed, all Europe—knew that England was in
earnest about her Indian Empire. Turkey’s position was
ascertained, so was Russia’s. Russia was propitiated by
Bessarabia, Kars, Ardahan, and Batoum; Turkey, gratified
by the retention of the great portion of what was to have
been Bulgaria’s, by the retention of Bayazid, by the great
region of Erzeroum, and of the valley of Alashkerd.</p>

<p>Further, Cyprus fell to the lot of England as a post “of
arms,” a strategical, a coasting and a coaling port of high
value for our Indian Empire, commanding as it does the
high-route which leads to the Euphrates Valley, and useful
besides for Egypt. He had noted this island on his youthful
trip in the East as most opportune for the purpose.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>Disraeli’s whole purview, in these arrangements, apart
from the defence of Great Britain, was to ensure a feasible
government under the watch of the European concert. This
intention is well expressed by the late Master of Balliol,
writing in 1877: “... I want to see the higher civilisation of
Europe combining against the lower and offering something
like a paternal government to ... the East. <em>But then there
is such a danger of taking away the government which they
have and substituting only chaos.</em> This might be avoided if
the European Powers would jointly take up their cause....”</p>

<p>I may be allowed to recall, in relation to some of these
matters, a few of Disraeli’s immediate after-utterances. They
are too often neglected.</p>

<p>As regards the English guarantee of the Porte against
Russian offence, attained by the Convention of Constantinople
which supplemented the treaty, he <span class="locked">observed—</span></p>

<p>“... Suppose now ... the settlement of Europe had
not included the Convention of Constantinople and the
occupation of the isle of Cyprus, ... what might ... have
occurred? In ten, fifteen, or twenty years, the power and
resources of Russia having revived, some quarrel would again
have occurred, Bulgarian or otherwise, and in all probability
the armies of Russia would have been assailing the Ottoman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
dominions, both in Europe and Asia; and enveloping and
inclosing the city of Constantinople, and its all-powerful
position. Well, what would be the probable conduct under
these circumstances of the Government ... whatever party
might be in power? <em>I fear there might be hesitation for a
time—a want of decision, a want of firmness</em>; but no one doubts
that ultimately England would have said, ‘This will never
do; we must prevent the conquest of Asia Minor; we must
interfere in this matter and arrest the course of Russia....’
Well, then, that being the case, I say it is extremely important
that this country <em>should take a step beforehand</em> which should
indicate what the policy of England would be.... The
responsibilities of England are practically diminished by
the course we have taken.... One of the results of my
attending the Congress of Berlin has been to prove, what I
always suspected to be an absolute fact, that neither the
Crimean, nor this horrible devastating war which has just
terminated, would have taken place if England had spoken
<em>with the necessary firmness</em>. Russia had complaints to make
against this country; that neither in the case of the Crimean
War, nor on this occasion—and I don’t shrink from my share
of the responsibility in this matter—<em>was the voice of England
so clear and decided as to exercise a due share in the guidance
of European opinion</em>.” Without such finality the treaty could
only have been patchwork. “That was not the idea of public
duty entertained by my noble friend and myself. We thought
the time had come when we should take steps which would
produce some order out of the anarchy chaos that had so long
prevailed. We asked ourselves was it absolutely a necessity
that the fairest provinces of the world should be the most
devastated and the most ill-used, and for this reason, that
there is no security for life and property so long as that
country is in perpetual fear of invasion and aggression....
<em>I hold that we have laid the foundation of a state of affairs
which may open a new continent to the civilisation of Europe</em>,
and that the welfare of the world, and the wealth of the
world, may be increased by availing ourselves of that tranquillity
and order which the more intimate connection of that
country with England will now produce....” And, added<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the late Lord Salisbury, “We were striving to pick up
the thread—the broken thread—of England’s old imperial
position.”</p>

<p>Before this utterance Disraeli had stated that the Convention’s
object was not only to confirm “tranquillity and order,”
but to safeguard India. “We have a substantial interest in
the East; it is a commanding interest, and its behest must
be obeyed.”—“In taking Cyprus,” he continued, “the movement
is not Mediterranean, it is Indian;” and, speaking of
Russia’s temptation to profit by a state of things which tended
to resolve the societies of Asia Minor and the countries
beyond into the anarchy of original elements, he used the
familiar words: “... <em>There is no reason for these constant
wars, or fears of wars between Russia and England.</em> Before
the circumstances which led to the recent disastrous war,
when none of those events which we have seen agitating the
world had occurred, and when we were speaking in another
place of the conduct of Russia in Central Asia, <em>I vindicated
that conduct, which I thought was unjustly attacked, and I said
then, what I repeat now, there is room enough for Russia and
England in Asia</em>.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, in another speech alluding to Austria’s
trusteeship of Bosnia, he said it permitted us to check,
“... I should hope for ever, that Pan-Slavist confederacy
and conspiracy which has already proved so disadvantageous
to the happiness of the world.” Nobody acquainted with
Austria’s desire for Salonica, Italy’s dread of that possibility,
and the fear of one at any rate of these powers lest
Greece should absorb Albania, can fail to grasp the relevance
of this hope.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that at the time these
deliverances were made Abdul Hamid<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> was not what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
seems since to have become. He was then—and the late
Sir William White was my informant—an enthusiastic reformer,
with the wise and accomplished Midhat for his
inspirer. Had he remained so Turkey would have achieved
much for Asia Minor. Even now, Abdul may perhaps be
sometimes excused for mistrusting the cant of reform on the
part of unreforming powers. Perhaps it is impossible long
to be Sultan of Turkey without falling into the faults bred
by habitual suspicion. Perhaps the varying conduct of
Western Powers conduces to cynicism. But at this period
the Armenians themselves were hopeful. With the Russian
aspiration I sympathise. Russia is destined to expansion
and greatness; she is a cold power desiring to be warm,
pushed by a military power eager to be forward. But she
is also that strange anomaly—a new empire with a mediæval
standard. With the freezing officialism of Russia, giant in
profession and pigmy in practice, I entertain no sympathy at
all. Nor are the Cossack barbarities a whit less infamous
than those of the Bashi-Bazouks. What is always to be
dreaded is the periodical recurrence of race-hatreds and barbarism
on the confines of both countries. Turkey comprises
many more races than Russia; at such times, therefore,
when bad governors incense brutalised men, unspeakable
horrors eclipse imagination and baffle even sympathy.
Bulgarian or Servian Slavs massacre Macedonian Greeks,
Albanians butcher Macedonian Serbs, and Turks both
massacre and torture Macedonian Slavs. The name of the
particular province inflamed at a specific time by revolutionary
committees is constantly used as if designating the
natural uprising of a united people or of a single race;
but this is not the case. The recent blood-orgy, however,
connived at by more than one of the powers, would seem
to disgrace the Ottoman beyond any other single group concerned.
And yet the normal Turk—soldier or peasant—is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
not naturally brutal. It is only when insulted fanaticism
dements him that he becomes so; and his fanaticism seldom
fans the flames unprovoked by foreign designs. Of course
nothing could be more desirable than a practical, a permanent
understanding with Russia; nothing more desirable than a
complete reform of European Turkey, which the joint powers
could enforce if they would unite. Both are consummations
devoutly to be wished. But bearing in mind the panther
tread of Russian diplomacies, their recent developments in
China and Japan, their constant designs on India and in
Persia, their stealthy hankering after Constantinople, their
earlier annexation even of American territory, as Disraeli
pointed out—is the former practical? By all means let
Russia expand, as she has a right to expand; but by all
means let England ascertain the due spheres of her expansion,
and retain her own empire, that gives justice and freedom to
countless races once oppressed. Nor let any cant of whatever
nature blind her eyes to the hard issues.</p>

<p>Throughout his pronouncements on foreign affairs is to
be discerned his construction of “balance of power” and of
“interference.” As regards the first, his principles are well
defined in a speech of 1864. “... The proper meaning of
‘balance of power’ is <em>security for communities</em> in general
against a predominant and particular power.” It also follows
“that you have to take into your consideration states and
influences that are not to be counted among the European
powers.” Every crisis in Europe bears on America and the
colonies. So early as 1848 he had pointed out that, though
insulted, “... yet our welfare as a great colonial power was
so intimately connected with European politics, that in seasons
of crisis we could only retire from interference at the expense
not only of our prestige but of our safety.” The “balance
of power” principle he derived from Bolingbroke; he also
adopted from Bolingbroke his principle of “interference.”</p>

<p>“... There are conditions,” he laid it down in 1860,
“under which it may be our imperative duty to interfere.
<em>We may clearly interfere in the affairs of foreign countries
when the interests or the honour of England are at stake, or
when, in our opinion, the independence of Europe is menaced.</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
But a great responsibility devolves upon that minister who
has to decide when those conditions have arisen; and he who
makes a mistake upon that subject, he who involves his
country in interference or in war under the idea that the
interests or honour of the country are concerned, when neither
is substantially involved, he who involves the country in
interference or war because he believes the independence of
Europe is menaced, when, in fact, it is not in danger, makes
of course a great, a fatal mistake. <em>The general principle that
we ought not to interfere in the affairs of foreign nations,
unless there is a clear necessity</em>, and that, generally speaking,
<em>it ought to be held a political dogma that the people of other
countries should</em> <span class="smcap smaller">SETTLE THEIR OWN AFFAIRS</span> <em>without the
introduction of foreign influence or foreign power, is one which
I trust the House ... will cordially adhere to</em>....” To this
let me add a passage from the great Denmark speech of
1864. It is its <span class="locked">corollary—</span></p>

<p>“... By the just influence of England in the councils
of Europe, I mean an influence contradistinguished from
that which is obtained by intrigue and secret understanding;
I mean an influence <em>that results from the conviction of foreign
powers that our resources are great, and that our policy is
moderate and steadfast</em>.... I lay this down as a great
principle which cannot be controverted in the management
of our foreign affairs. <em>If England is resolved upon a particular
policy, war is not probable.</em>”</p>

<p>One illustration is worth many arguments. At the Berlin
Congress affairs at a time began to march ill. The Russian
plenipotentiary was making mischief. Disraeli quietly pencilled
some requisitions on the part of England and forwarded them
to him. “If you accept these,” he said, “peace—if not, war.”</p>

<p>Bearing these two further principles of foreign policy in
mind, let me endeavour to sketch Disraeli’s attitude towards
various other powers. With America I deal separately in the
next chapter.</p>

<p>Friendship with France amounted with him almost to a
passion, and none would have rejoiced more heartily at the
amity which our King has recently renewed. He himself knew
the French well, and in the ’forties had met with the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
cordial welcome on two occasions from the King, the Court,
the lights of literature and science, the politicians and the
people. He thought that with French alliance other powers
might exclaim as Shakespeare’s Constance <span class="locked">exclaimed—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“France friends with England, what become of me!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">France was the nation of society, the nurse of arts and
manners. England and France supplied reciprocal wants.
Their friendship is a pledge for European peace. Had the
Czar been made aware of it in time, the blunder and misfortune
of the Crimean War would not have taken place. In
<cite>Coningsby</cite> he called Paris “the university of the world,” and
enlarged on commercial exchange between two first-class
powers in a vein at once light and serious. In 1845, France
regarded Peel as the guardian of Anglo-French cordiality,
and feared the chance of Palmerston’s return to office as
fraught with a possible treatment of “the French connection
with levity or disregard.” Louis Philippe relieved his anxieties
by consulting Disraeli on this point.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>“A good understanding,” was Disraeli’s interpretation in
1864, “between England and France is simply this—that so
far as the influence of these two great powers extends, the
affairs of the world shall be conducted by their co-operation
instead of by their rivalry. <em>But co-operation requires not
merely identity of interest but reciprocal good feeling. In public
as well as in private affairs, a certain degree of sentiment is
necessary for the happy conduct of matters.</em>” In another speech
ten years earlier he also observed that Anglo-French relations
were not dynastic, but depended on commercial interests.</p>

<p>Perhaps his most remarkable expression on this theme
occurs in a speech of 1853,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> when Sir James Graham had gone
about saying that the Emperor was a despot who turned his
people into slaves, and when there was one of those periodical
outbursts of Gallophobia to which we are accustomed. Disraeli
pointed out that peace with France had then subsisted for
forty years, that social relations had multiplied, that an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
identity of interest in high policy existed. He exploded the
fallacy that national hostility was a true tradition. Even
Agincourt and Crécy stood for a struggle between two
princes rather than between two nations. “... No one can
deny that both Queen Elizabeth and the Lord Protector
looked to that alliance as the basis of their foreign connections.
No one can deny that there was one subject on which even
the brilliant Bolingbroke and the sagacious Walpole were
agreed—and that was the great importance of cultivating an
alliance, or good understanding, with France. At a later date
the most eminent of the statesmen of this century, Mr.
Pitt, formed his system on this principle....” The traditional
prejudice, therefore, was the reverse of true. The
natural tendency was to concord, for after the great European
revolutions at the close of the eighteenth and dawn of the
nineteenth centuries, a durable peace had emerged. Nor
were the defences (which Sir Robert Peel had really
inaugurated) due to the rise of the Third Napoleon; they
were due to the changes in scientific warfare. It was true
that in France there was then a military government. “But
there is a great error also, if history is to guide us, in
assuming that because a country is governed by an army,
that army must be extremely anxious to conquer other
countries.” The lust for conquest under militarism is due to
home-uneasiness, and from a feeling in the army that its
power is not felt. The real prejudice was that France had
subverted her constitution. This prejudice had foundation,
but it was the very cause of those acts which indiscreet
journalism was now criticising so angrily. “Some years
ago,” he resumed (and the glimpse of Louis Philippe is
interesting), “I had occasion frequently to visit France. I
found that country then under the mild sway of a constitutional
monarch—of a prince who, from temper as well as
policy, was humane and beneficent. I know that at that time
the Press was free. I know that at that time the Parliament
of France was ... distinguished by its eloquence, and by
a dialectic power that probably even our own House of
Commons has never surpassed. I know that under these
circumstances France arrived at a pitch of material prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
which it had never before reached. I know also that after a
reign of unbroken prosperity of long duration, when he was
aged, when he was in sorrow, and when he was suffering
under overwhelming indisposition, this same prince was rudely
expelled from his capital,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> and was denounced as a poltroon
by all the journals of England, because he did not command
his troops to fire upon the people. Well, other powers and other
princes have since occupied his seat, who have asserted their
authority in a very different way, and are denounced in the
same organs as tyrants because they did order their troops to
fire upon the people. I think every man has a right to have
his feelings upon these subjects; but what is the moral I
presume to draw upon these circumstances? It is this, that it
is extremely difficult to form an opinion upon French politics;
<em>and that so long as the French people are exact in their commercial
transactions and friendly in their political relations, it is just as
well that we should not interfere with their management of their
domestic concerns</em>.”</p>

<p>The same ideas animated him in 1854, when he pointed
out that ten years earlier the Czar had, by a secret manœuvre,
sought to provoke an estrangement which had not endured, but
which the Czar was led to believe enduring when the Crimean
War broke out. The same guided his hearty approval of Mr.
Cobden’s aims in relation to France. What he objected to in
the later Italian Treaty was that it embodied “reciprocity” too
late—at a time when for England reciprocity could secure no
more. In 1858—the Walewski affair—Disraeli termed our
alliance with France “the key and corner-stone of modern
civilisation.” After the Treaty of Villafranca, Disraeli advised
England not “to go to congresses and conferences in fine
dresses and ribands, to enjoy the petty vanity of settling the
fate of petty princes,” but to have recourse to “your ally
the Emperor of the French”—a monarch who, as Disraeli
said some years afterwards, “... has been created and can
only be maintained by the sympathies of his people—a proud,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
imperious, and apt to be discontented people.” In 1860,
when many were jubilant over Italy’s united nationality,
Disraeli, demonstrating its present incompleteness, asserted
that its accomplishment must come not through the “moral
influence of England,” but “by the will and the sword of
France”—though this did not blind him to contingent
perils.</p>

<p>“It is the will of France that can alone restore Rome to
the Italians. It is the sword of France, if any sword can do
it, that alone can free Venetia from the Austrians.” But in
a long and splendid speech he urged, almost prophetically,
that by forcing the French Emperor to a policy which he
was unwilling to pursue, we should eventually give him a
dangerous preponderance: “... It will be in his power ...
to make those greater changes and <em>aim at those greater results
which I will only intimate and not attempt to describe</em>.” In
1864, on the Danish crisis, advocating firmness of action
following on firmness of statement, he once more repeated:
“... If there is, under these circumstances, a cordial alliance
between England and France, war is most difficult; but if
there is a thorough understanding between England, France,
and Russia, war is impossible.” Though here, again, this
consideration would not deter him from the single object of
England’s welfare.</p>

<p>Finally, he consulted French sentiment in the delicate
arrangement at Berlin. “... There is no step of this kind
that I would take without considering the effect it might have
upon the feelings of France—a nation to whom we are bound
by almost every tie that can unite a people.... We avoided
Egypt, knowing how susceptible France is with regard to
Egypt; we avoided Syria; ... and we avoided availing
ourselves of any part of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">terra firma</i>, because we would
not hurt the feelings or excite the suspicions of France....
But the interests of France ... are, as she acknowledges,
sentimental and traditionary interests; and although I respect
them, ... we must remember that our connection with the
East is not merely an affair of sentiment and tradition, but
that we have urgent and substantial and enormous interests
which we must guard and keep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
I pass now to Germany. Prussia, in his early days, he
had described as “the Persia” of Europe; the Austrians as
“the Chinese.” Some thirty years before Germany became
united, and Bismarck had brandished the mailed fist, Disraeli
regarded much in the air as “dreamy and dangerous nonsense;”
he considered theory and “inner consciousness” as
distinctive of the German nature, and he failed to perceive
the rising wave of its instinct for united nationality. Here
certainly his foresight flagged. When Prussia dismembered
Denmark, he pointed out that by the arguments used she, too,
might be deprived of Posen. Here certainly his foresight
failed. But when the great war broke out, he rose to the
occasion and realised its meaning to the full. “It is no
common war,” he said at the onset, “like that between Prussia
and Austria, or like the Italian war in which France was
engaged some years ago; nor is it like the Crimean War.
This war represents the German revolution, a greater <em>political</em>
event than the French Revolution of last century. I don’t say
a greater or as great a social event. What its social consequences
may be are in the future. Not a single principle,
accepted by all statesmen for guidance in the management
of our foreign affairs up to six months ago, any longer exists.
There is not a diplomatic tradition that has not been swept
away. You have a new world, new influences at work, new
and unknown objects and dangers with which to cope, at
present involved in the obscurity incident to the novelty of
such affairs.... Lord Palmerston, eminently a practical man,
trimmed the ship of State and shaped its policy with a view
to preserve an equilibrium in Europe. But what has come to
pass? The balance of power has been entirely destroyed,
and the country which suffers, and feels the effects of this
great change most, is England.” He recommended an attitude
of “armed neutrality,” such as Austria’s occupation of the
Danubian provinces, which certainly abridged the Crimean
War. Such a policy tends to prevent, if possible, to shorten
if it cannot prevent a conflict; and when that conflict is
finished, to temper the terms for the vanquished. Had it
been feasible in the then state of our armaments, it might
have produced lasting results. As time went on Disraeli<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
grew to understand Germany better, though he never ceased
to regret the humiliation to France. In Bismarck, however,
he found a powerful friend, and one of his last utterances
regarding Germany was to praise her as a peacemaker.</p>

<p>At the Berlin Congress Lord Beaconsfield made his
speeches in English. This was of design. A story was told
that an eminent English diplomatist, in attendance on his
chief, had adroitly suggested this course out of apprehension
that “Dizzy’s” French accent might not impress foreign
representatives. But however this may have been, I am convinced
it was not the real reason, which was to assert the
leadership of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Disraeli’s French was fluent, if insular. In Italian he
was naturally proficient. Italian literature was familiar to
him, and next to Dante, he was fondest of Alfieri, a fine
passage from whom, it will be remembered, he quotes in
<cite>Lothair</cite>. He knew German well enough to read it.</p>

<p>No sentiment surrounded his favour to Austria. It was
her partition that he feared. So early as 1848 he
objected, from the sole standpoint of England’s interest, to
championing the Magyars and the Italians against Austria,
the Sicilians against Naples. We should, he then said, “mind
our own business.” And in 1856, when he combated the
views of his opponents who sighed for the dismemberment
of Russia, he also pointed out the dangers to European peace
that must attend the dismemberment of Austria. The complete
dismemberment of that empire—partly a few years
later to be accomplished—would involve the independence
of Hungary and the emancipation of Italy.</p>

<p>With Italy herself he nourished, indeed, an innate
sympathy, and for her a sentimental attachment. In all
his reveries Venice and Rome figure no less frequently than
do Athens and Jerusalem; and afterwards none applauded
Daniel Manin more than he. Italy is the haunting refrain
of <cite>Venetia</cite>, Venice of <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite>, Rome romanticises
<cite>Lothair</cite>. Perhaps a leaven of his old enthusiasm for “a
cluster of small states” and “federal unions” still mingled
with the practical outlook which also made him sacrifice
many of his personal emotions to the cold requirements of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
statesmanship. “Federal unions,” he had sighed in <em>Contarini</em>,
“would preserve us from the consequences of local jealousy.”—“There
would be more genius, and, what is of more
importance, much more felicity.”—“<em>Italy might then revive.</em>”
However this may be—and I for one regret his forced attitude
towards the first flutter of Italian freedom—or whether his
late acquaintance with Metternich had coloured his ideas,
there can be no doubt of their constraining cause. His public
views always confined themselves to what he believed was
for the benefit of Great Britain. And in this instance—“...
If we, or any other power,” he urged, “should forcibly
interfere in the affairs of Italy with the view of changing the
political settlement of that country, the result will be, as in
the case of an attempt to dismember Russia, one of those
protracted wars that might fatally exhaust this country, and
which, even supposing it to be successful, would leave Italy
very possibly not in the possession of Austria, but under
the dominion of some other power as little national.” It
should be recollected that 1858–61 were critical years for
Anglo-French relations. After Palmerston’s Orsini imbroglio
we were more than once on the verge of war with France.
Luckily, England was never forced into interference. Luckily,
Italy regained her independence, through two commanding
individualities. But it was history that warned Disraeli.
Italy had been the battle-field of Austria and Spain, and a
prolific source of war, disorder, and havoc throughout the
eighteenth century. “A war in Italy,” he said in 1859, “is
not a war in a corner. An Italian war may by possibility be
an European war. The waters of the Adriatic cannot be disturbed
without agitating the waters of the Rhine. The port
of Trieste is not a mere Italian port. It is a port which
belongs to the Italian confederation, and an attack on Trieste
is not an attack on Austria alone, but also on Germany. If
war springs up beyond the precincts of Italy, <em>England has
interests not merely from ... those enlightened principles of
civilisation which make her look with an adverse eye on aught
that would disturb the peace of the world, but England may be
interested from material considerations of the most urgent and
momentous character</em>.” It was from England’s vantage-ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
alone that he discussed these questions in public. He wished
Italy to be free, but he feared the results of ineffective feeling.
Italy, he held, must free herself, and her aid, if any, should be
French, not English, for France heads the Latin League. In
1859 he rested on a mutual accord and disarmament between
Great Britain and France. This would, he pleaded, be “a
conquest far more valuable than Lombardy, or those wild
dreams of a regeneration ever promised but never accomplished.”
“National independence,” he urged in another
speech on the same subject, “is not created by protocols, nor
public liberty guaranteed by treaties. All such arrangements
have been tried before, and the consequence has been a sickly
and short-lived offspring. What is going on in Italy—never
mind whose may have been the original fault, what the present
errors—<em>can only be solved by the will, the energy, the sentiment,
and the thought of the population themselves</em>.”</p>

<p>One word before I close this chapter about Greece and
Poland. Of his own feeling for Hellas there can be no
question. It pervades his works. “All the great things
have been done by the little peoples.” He was offered, I
have heard, the kingship of that country. But Greek ambitions,
he felt, outgrew her capacities. Her hereditary dream
has always been Constantinople. He bade her, in a famous
passage, take the advice that he would give to a youth of
genius and enterprise: “<em>Be patient</em>.” But he also insisted
that she should be heard at the Conference of Berlin.</p>

<p>With Poland’s free aspirations he always sympathised,
and more than once expressed the grounds of his sympathy
in Parliament. The movement in Poland was one, natural,
spontaneous, and national. It was not forced by agitators,
nor fomented by despots, nor provoked elsewhere from
ulterior motives. It was the genuine expression of a combined
people, and not the plea of a single race overbearing its fellow
components, or the pretence of a single locality to manage
itself, both of which have so frequently proved the stalking-horse
of “national rights;” pleas that, if sound, would bring
back the Heptarchy in England, undo the union of Germany
and of Italy, break up the faculty for government, and resolve
into petty elements every great nation in Europe. Such an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
article of “liberal” faith is neither more nor less than political
atomism; and its humanitarian guise too often the false
philanthropy of “sublime sentiments.” In all his treatment of
“Britain’s interests abroad,” Disraeli realised that whereas in
England government can still be carried on by “traditionary
influences,” the remaining ancient communities of Europe
were falling more and more under the veiled sway of “military
force.” These were the two alternatives. A “reconstruction”
of England “on the great Transatlantic model” would only
accentuate the discrepancy between the ineradicable features
of her body politic, and the social standard which she would
seek to imitate. The result would be that “after a due course
of paroxysms for the sake of maintaining order and securing
the rights of industry, the State quits the senate and takes
refuge in the <span class="locked">camp”—</span></p>

<p>“Let us not be deluded by forms of government. The
word may be republic in France, constitutional monarchy
in Prussia, absolute monarchy in Austria, but the King is the
same. <em>Wherever there is a vast standing army the government
is the government of the sword.</em> Half a million of armed men
must either be, or be not, in a state of discipline. If not...
it is not government but anarchy; if they be in a state of
discipline, they must obey one man, and that man is the
master.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>I have tried to track a large subject deserving a longer
space. At any rate, I hope to have justified Disraeli’s own
language in the touching letter which breathed farewell to
his constituents when failing health compelled him to accept
an <span class="locked">earldom—</span></p>

<p>“Throughout my public life I have aimed at two chief
results. Not insensible to the principle of progress, I have
endeavoured to reconcile change with that respect for tradition
which is one of the main elements of our social strength;
and in external affairs I have endeavoured to develop and
strengthen our empire, <em>believing that a combination of achievement
and responsibility elevates the character and condition of a
people</em>.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I</span> have associated these two heads of discussion because
they have long been coupled in home politics, at times
disastrously, but now, it may be hoped, under favouring
auspices. On the lighter side of American society and its
first invasions of England he also touched. I shall touch these
in the next chapter, reserving this for the political aspects of
the question. My first chapter has already mentioned the
paragraph in his earliest pamphlet, dedicated to Canning.</p>

<p>Disraeli was always intensely interested in America, and
watched her development with vigilance. He predicted her
imperial future. He deprecated jealousy of her power, and,
while England was incensed at her conduct in 1871, he alone
maintained that it was due to the prejudices of a class and the
objects of a party, not to the national sentiment. He descried
in America’s essential democracy, which adheres even to her
republican forms, one wholly peculiar to herself—a democracy
of the soil, of which the base and root is land, underlying the
gigantic commerce and colossal finance which are merely the
froth of her wealth; and in such a democracy he perceived an
element of stability lacking to every other known democratic
country. Before her crucial conflict was determined, he prophesied,
too, among the difficulties that must confront her, that
of a vast number of emancipated negroes. When the great
struggle arose between the energy of the North and the
traditions of the South, Disraeli also, alone among the leaders
of his party, discerned both the probabilities of the winning
side and its aptitude for moderation and self-control. For this
sagacity he received Mr. Bright’s approbation in 1865. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
the civil war was in process, the gentry of England, naturally
and generously sympathetic with the Southerners, had suspected
that Canada might be threatened, and had wished
something “to be done;” Disraeli restrained and allayed them.
Mr. Bright said: “With a thoughtfulness and statesmanship
which you do not all acknowledge, he did not say a word from
that bench likely to create a difficulty with the United States.
I think his chief and his followers might learn something from
his example.” I quote this meed from an opponent, because
Mr. Bryce, in his recent monograph, implies the contrary; but
then, Mr. Bryce sometimes trips, and has made the trifling
mistake of naming “Lucian” as Disraeli’s pet classic, whereas
surely it was “Tacitus.”</p>

<p>Disraeli’s leading idea as to America was that, although
she had long achieved independence, her original spirit had
remained colonial, but that her civil war would transform
the past colony into a coming empire. Speaking in 1863, he
<span class="locked">said—</span></p>

<p>“I am bound to say that from the first—and subsequent
events have only confirmed my convictions—I have always
looked upon the struggle in America in the light of a great
revolution.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Great revolutions, whatever may be their alleged
causes, are not likely to be commenced, or to be concluded,
with precipitation. <em>Before the civil war commenced, the United
States were colonies</em>, because we should not forget that such
communities do not cease to be colonies because they are
independent. <em>They were not only colonies, but colonising</em>; and
they existed under all the conditions of colonial life except
that of mere political dependence. <em>But even before the civil
war</em>, I think that all impartial observers must have been
convinced that in that community <em>there were smouldering
elements which indicated the possibility of a change, and perhaps
of a violent change</em>. The immense increase of population; the
still greater increase of wealth; the introduction of foreign
races in large numbers as citizens, not brought up under the
laws and customs which were adapted to a more limited, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
practically a more homogeneous, race; the character of the
political constitution, consequent, perhaps, on these circumstances;
<em>the absence of any theatre for the ambitious and refined
intellects of the country, which deteriorated public spirit and
lowered public morality</em>; and, above all, <em>the increasing influence
of the United States upon the political fortunes of Europe</em>;—these
were all circumstances which indicated <em>the more than possibility
that the mere colonial character of these communities might
suddenly be violently subverted, and those imperial characteristics
appear which seem to be the destiny of man</em>. I cannot conceal
from myself the conviction that, whoever in this House may be
young enough to live to witness the ultimate consequences of
this civil war, will see, whenever the waters have subsided, a
different America from that which was known to our fathers,
and even from that of which this generation has had so much
experience. <em>It will be an America of armies, of diplomacy, of
rival states and manœuvring cabinets, of frequent turbulence,
and probably of frequent wars.</em> With these views, I have
myself, during the last session, exerted whatever influence I
possessed in endeavouring to dissuade my friends from
embarrassing her Majesty’s Government in that position of
politic and dignified reserve which they appeared to me to
have taken upon this question. It did not appear to me,
looking at these transactions across the Atlantic, <em>not as events
of a mere casual character, but being such as might probably
influence, as the great French Revolution influenced, and is still
influencing, European affairs</em>, that there was on our part, due
to the <em>existing authorities</em> in America, a large measure of
deference in the difficulties which they had to encounter. At
the same time, it was natural to feel ... the greatest respect
for those Southern States, who, representing a vast population
of men, were struggling for some of the greatest objects of
existence—independence and power....”</p>

<p>Long before this—in 1856—he had said, when America’s
attitude towards Central American troubles was irritating
England, that in his opinion “... it would be wise if England
would at last recognise that the United States, like all
the great countries of Europe, <em>had a policy, and a right to
have a policy</em>. It was foolish for England to regard with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
jealousy <em>any legitimate extension of the territory of the United
States beyond the bounds originally fixed</em>.” Such a jealousy
would not arrest or retard the development of America; but
it might involve disasters. He instanced California and the
gloomy forebodings at home with regard to it, none of which
had been realised; and he impressed upon the House that
“<em>It was the business of a statesman to recognise the necessity of
an increase of power in the States.</em>” The same year evoked
another speech which forecasts the tenour of that in 1863,
and is a fresh witness of the continuity of his imaginative
insight, and his wakeful constancy of his purpose. After
deprecating jealousy of America’s political and commercial
progress, he thus <span class="locked">proceeded—</span></p>

<p>“... I cannot forget that the United States, though
independent, <em>are still in some sense colonies, and are influenced
by colonial tendencies</em>; and when they come in contact with
large portions of territory scarcely populated, or at the most
sparsely occupied by an indolent and unintelligent race of
men, <em>it is impossible—and you yourselves find it impossible—to
resist the tendency to expansion; and expansion in that sense is
not injurious to England</em>, for it contributes to the wealth of
this country (let us say this in a whisper, lest it cross the
Atlantic) more than it diminishes the power of the United
States. In our foreign relations with the United States,
therefore, I am opposed to that litigious spirit of jealousy
which looks upon the expansion of that country and the
advance of these young communities with an eye of jealousy
and distrust.”</p>

<p>What he realised and first proclaimed, was that America
was ceasing to be a mongrel blend or a colonial people, and
was fast becoming a national community, with a voice, a
vigour, a tendency, and in every department a twang, so to
say, of its own; that, moreover, this consolidation would tend
towards empire, and that England must prepare for and
reckon with it, especially as a partial crudeness and rudeness
are to some extent inseparable from developments so sudden.
It had not always been thus. Even long after the Puritan
settlement, the primæval charm of an aboriginal race clung
to its forests and prairies. The strain, the science of race,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
fascinated Disraeli; the unsubdued and the untameable ever
appealed to him. Races could only be replaced by nations;
and the interval was always atomic and confused; but it was
also one of primitive dash and daring. As a youth, Disraeli,
in <em>Contarini</em>, had dreamed of such a life. In <cite>Venetia</cite><a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> he had
wondered whether the Atlantic would ever be so memorable
as the Mediterranean; whether pushfulness would ever attain
refinement; whether its provincialism might not be doomed
to weakness. “... Its civilisation will be more rapid,
but will it be ... as permanent?... What America is
deficient in is creative intelligence. <em>It has no nationality.</em>
Its intelligence has been imported like its manufactured
goods. <em>Its inhabitants are a people, but are they a nation?</em>
I wish that the empire of the Incas and the kingdom of
Montezuma had not been sacrificed. I wish that the republic
of the Puritans had blended with the tribes of the
Wilderness.”</p>

<p>Two dangers for England, however, emanated from
America; and perhaps they were connected. The one was
American Anglophobia, the other Fenianism. The one
might estrange our North American colonies; the other was
to imperil our national unity.</p>

<p>In 1865, Disraeli addressed himself to the former. The
American war was not then decided. He was not of opinion
that, when it ended, our connection with Canada would bring
us into collision with America. He did not believe that if
the North was vanquished, it would “feel inclined to enter
immediately into another struggle with a power not inferior
in determination and in resources to the Southern States of
America;” and he saw many rocks ahead to divert the
advancing <span class="locked">tide—</span></p>

<p>“I form that opinion because I believe that the people
of the United States are eminently a sagacious people. I
don’t think they are insensible to the glory of great dominion
and extended empire, and I give them equally credit for
being influenced by passions which actuate mankind, and
particularly nations which enjoy such freedom as they do.
But ... I do not think they would seize the moment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
exhaustion as being the most favourable for the prosecution
of an enterprise which would require great resources and
great exertions.”</p>

<p>He then turned to the opinions which had been ventilated
on American platforms and in certain American newspapers.
He refused to judge the real American character and opinions
by them. “I look upon them,” he said, “as I should look
upon those strange and fantastic drinks ... which are such
favourites on the other side of the Atlantic; and I should as
soon suppose this rowdy rhetoric was the expression of the
real feelings of the American people, as that these potations
formed the aliment and nutriment of their bodies.” And he
thus explained a point which I have already noticed: “There
is another reason why this violent course will not be adopted.
The democracy of America must not be confounded with the
democracy of the Old World. <em>It is not formed by the scum
of turbulent cities</em>: neither is it merely a section of an exhausted
middle class, <em>which speculates in stocks and calls that
progress. It is a territorial democracy.</em> Aristotle, who has
taught us most of the wise things we know, never said a
wiser one than this—that the cultivators of the soil are the
least inclined to sedition and to violent courses. Now, being
a territorial democracy, their character has been formed and
influenced, in a manner, by the property with which they are
connected, and by the pursuits they follow; and a sense of
responsibility arising from the reality of their possessions
may much influence their future conduct. On the other
hand, this great change would certainly alter the spirit of
society, and perhaps of government.” But he saw clearly
the difficulties that still beset her. “... We must recollect
that even if the Federal Government should be triumphant,
it will have to deal with most perplexing questions and with
a discontented population.... The slave population will
then be no longer slaves. <em>There will be several millions of
another race emancipated and invested with all the rights of
freemen; and, so far as the letter of the law is concerned, they
will be upon an equality with the Saxon race, with whom they
can possibly have no sympathy.... Nothing tends more to
the discontent of a people than that they should be in possession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
of privileges and rights which practically are not recognised,
and which they do not enjoy.</em>”</p>

<p>Such were the elements of disunion. To cope with
them a strong government was requisite; and that meant a
<em>centralising</em> government with a military force at its command
to uphold unity and order. Our colonies, on the other hand,
were free from such obstacles, and were themselves developing
an “element of nationality.” They would not be assailed.
But none the less, we must reckon with the United States
in “the balance of power.” He would not say that a class
in America regarded old Europe “with feelings of jealousy
or vindictiveness,” “... but it is undeniable that the United
States look to old Europe with <em>a want of sympathy. They
have no sympathy with a country that is created and sustained
by tradition.</em>” We must, therefore, for the far future, foster
and defend our colonies. If Canada had preferred absorption
by America, “... we might terminate our connection
with dignity, and without disaster.” But if, as appeared,
Canada and our North American colonies desired deeply
and sincerely “to form a considerable state and develop its
resources, and to preserve the patronage and aid of England,
... then it would be the greatest political blunder that could
be conceived, for us to renounce, relinquish, and avoid the
responsibility of maintaining our interests in Canada.”</p>

<p>American Anglophobia once more engaged his attention
in 1871. The pith of his criticism may be summarised by
the purport of that elegant metaphor, “Twisting the lion’s
tail.” With regard to the <cite>Alabama</cite> claims, their “indirect”
demands, and the disputes with our colonies, which once
more provoked British feeling, Disraeli now complained that
America’s communications with England had been couched
in arrogant terms, while those with Russia and Germany had
been courteous. He declared that it was caused by rowdy
rhetoric addressed to “irresponsible millions.” “... The
reason of this offensive conduct,” he continued, “is this:
there is a <em>party</em> in America, <em>who certainly do not monopolise
the intelligence, education, and property of the country, and who,
I believe, are not numerically the strongest, who attempt to
obtain political power and excite political passion by abusing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
England and its Government, because they believe they can
do so with impunity</em>.... The danger is this. Habitually
exciting the passions of millions, some unfortunate thing
happens, or something unfortunate is said in either country;
the fire lights up, it is beyond their control, and the two
nations are landed in a contest which they can no longer
prevent.... Though I should look upon it as the darkest
hour of my life, if I were to counsel, or even to support, a
war with the United States, still, the United States should
know that they are not an exception to the other countries
of the world, that we do not permit ourselves to be insulted
by any other country in the world, and that they cannot be
an exception.” Nevertheless, with regard to these very
matters, he reiterated as late as 1872: “Ever since I sat in
this House, I have always endeavoured to maintain and
cherish relations of cordiality and confidence between the
United Kingdom and the United States. I have felt that
between those two great countries the material interests
were so vast, <em>were likely so greatly to increase</em>, and were
in their character so mutually beneficial to both countries,
that they alone formed bonds of union.... But I could not
forget that, in the relations between the United States and
England, <em>there was an element also of sentiment</em>, which ought
never to be despised in politics, and without which there can
be no enduring alliance. When the unhappy Civil War
occurred, I endeavoured, therefore, so far as I could, to
maintain ... a strict neutrality between the Northern and the
Southern states.... There were some at a particular time
... who were anxious to obtain the recognition of the
Southern states by this country. I never could share that
opinion.... We were of opinion that, had that recognition
occurred, it would not have averted the final catastrophe, ...
and it would, at the same time, have necessarily involved this
country in a war with the Northern states, <em>while there were
circumstances then existing in Europe which made us believe
that the war might not have been limited to America</em>.”</p>

<p>I must now consider Fenianism. Every one now knows
that Fenianism, at its inception in 1865, though its pretext
was Ireland and its rallying centre America, was really an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
<em>international</em> ruffianism for the disruption of the foundations
of social order—was, in fact, an alliance of anarchists with
soldiers of misfortune. Disraeli discerned this from the first.
Plots and conspiracies of all kinds piqued at once his curiosity,
his skill, and his fancy. I was told, more than thirty years
ago, by an old gentleman who was a schoolfellow of Disraeli,
that he remembered a boyish mutiny. Disraeli headed the
conspiracy, and the head-master himself listened at the keyhole,
spellbound by the eloquence that controlled it. He
loved to unravel their machinations, to contrast their underground
conclaves with their open appearance. Conspiracies
abound in <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, <cite>Alroy</cite>, <cite>Iskander</cite>, <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite>,
<cite>Sybil</cite>, and <cite>Tancred</cite>; these very secret societies, together
with those of Jesuitry, pervade <cite>Lothair</cite>. “Mirandola” and
“Captain Bruges” are drawn from life. When Fenianism
raged in Ireland, Disraeli himself crossed the Channel and
attended their meetings. He spoke about what he knew;
and if secret societies were his hobby, he was yet undoubtedly
right in ascribing most of the unforeseen abroad to their
initiation.</p>

<p>Adverting, in 1872, to its fatal influence on Ireland, he
remarked: “... The Civil War in America had just ceased,
and a band of military adventurers, Poles, Italians, and many
Irishmen, concocted at New York a conspiracy to invade
Ireland, with the belief that the whole country would rise to
welcome them. How that conspiracy was baffled ... I need
not now remind you.... You remember how the constituencies
were appealed to, to vote against the Government
who had made so unfit an appointment as that of Lord Mayo
to the Viceroyalty of India. It was by his great qualities
when Secretary for Ireland, by his vigilance, his courage,
his patience, and his perseverance, that this conspiracy was
defeated. He knew what was going on at New York, just as
well as what was going on in the city of Dublin?...” And
when, only a year before, the then Lord Hartington, at a
moment of Fenian resurrection, withdrew his motion for a
secret committee, Disraeli inveighed against an indecision
that would be flashed in an hour across the Atlantic. This
new movement of Fenianism brought America into dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
relations with England. And in many disguises and under mitigated
forms, it half associated itself with the agitation for repeal,
and the restless intrigues of the Papacy. Paid Nationalists
and peasant priests were brought into connection with these
Swiss guards of treason, ready to compass the destruction of
property and authority in any country, and for any cause.
It had been otherwise before its invention in America. When
O’Connell—the great O’Connell as, despite everything, Disraeli
publicly confessed when he died—supported Disraeli (who
began as an “Independent”) at his first election in 1832,
he did so on the common ground that both abominated the
Whig system and desired the extension of reform. It was
only afterwards, when O’Connell pronouncedly lent himself to
what tended towards a repetition of “Captain Rock,” and
became at once an agitator for dismemberment<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> and a
pillar of the Whigs, that the young Disraeli denounced the
fellowship of the dagger with the mitre, and incensed the
degenerating patriot into insult. But the violence in Ireland
of O’Connell’s days was native. It sprang from, and it disgraced,
the soil. Fenianism, however, added to the ancient
terrors of a country distressed to madness and goaded into
crime, the worst horrors of cosmopolitan conspiracies mated
with every movement for the unsettlement of Europe; and
for a while it tainted every breath of Irish nationalism,
not only with detestation of England, but with enthusiasm
for her enemies. The “Clan-na-gael” still foments the
last vestiges of genuine discontent; but the headquarters
seem to have shifted from New York to a European capital.
And yet so unconcerted and unprepared was Ireland herself,
however equipped and compact were these mercenary
foreigners, that Disraeli makes “Captain Bruges” exclaim in
<cite>Lothair</cite>, after his rescue of the hero at the meeting, held
under the sham banners of St. Joseph and harangued by a
mock priest, “They manage their affairs in general wonderfully
close, but I have no opinion of them. I have just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
returned from Ireland, where I thought I would go and see
what they really are after. No real business in them. Their
treason is a fairy tale, and their sedition a child talking in its
sleep.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>And this brings me to Disraeli’s ideas concerning the
romantic, the persecuted, the generous, the witty, the pathetic
Ireland.</p>

<p>No one who has studied his career can question his intense
sympathy. Many of his earliest friends had been brilliant
Irishmen and Irishwomen. He too sprang from a race once
persecuted, still pathetic, always witty and romantic. Already,
in 1843, Disraeli had exclaimed: “You must reorganise and
reconstruct the Government, and even the social state of
Ireland.... By really penetrating into the mystery of this
great misgovernment” might be brought about “a state of
society which would be advantageous both to England and
Ireland, and which would put an end to a state of things
that was the bane of England and opprobrium of Europe.”
But his ideas are conspicuously set forth in the great speech
of 1844, which won the high praise of Macaulay, which
Mr. Gladstone, some quarter of a century later, described as
one of the “most closely woven tissues of argument and
observation that had ever been heard in the House,” and the
reperusal of which he recommended as an intellectual “treat;”
though Disraeli himself then ironically observed that when he
delivered it, nobody appeared to listen. “It seemed to me
that I was pouring water upon sand, but it seems now that
the water came from a golden goblet.” He showed that,
politically, Ireland was an open question. It was not the
Tories who started the penal code. Mr. Pitt would have
settled the question long ago had not the great war diverted
his policy. Again, the grievances of Ireland were not due to
Protestantism. They were owing to Puritanism—Puritanism
in disloyal rebellion against which loyal Ireland rebelled.
Ireland, he proved, was never so contented as in 1635. There
was then perfect civil and religious equality. “At that period
there was a Parliament in Dublin called by a Protestant king,
presided over by a Protestant viceroy, and at that moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
there was a Protestant Established Church in Ireland; yet
the majority of the members of that Parliament were Roman
Catholics. The government was at that time carried on by
a council of state presided over by a Protestant deputy, yet
many of the members of that council were Roman Catholics.
The municipalities were then full of Roman Catholics. Several
of the sheriffs also were Roman Catholics, and a very considerable
number of magistrates were Roman Catholics. <em>It
is, therefore, very evident that it is not the necessary consequence
of English connection—of a Protestant monarchy, or even of
a Protestant Church—that this embittered feeling at present
exists; nor that that system of exclusion, which either in form
or spirit has so long existed, is the consequence of Protestantism.</em>”</p>

<p>It was not the Protestantism, not the connection, but the
kind of Protestantism, the sort of connection, the exclusive
and selfish spirit, that filled Ireland with ferment.</p>

<p>Hitherto Government had offered “a little thing in a
great way.”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> “Justice to Ireland” had been long cried on
the housetops. What was the meaning of that cry? It
only signified a forced <em>identity</em> of English institutions with
Irish. Identity, however, was just what Ireland resented with
disgust.</p>

<p>What were her stumbling-blocks and stones of offence?
What was “the Irish question”? “One says it is a physical
question, another a spiritual. Now it is the absence of the
aristocracy, now the absence of railroads. It is the Pope one
day, potatoes the next. Let us consider Ireland as we should
any other country similarly situated.... Then we shall see
a teeming population, which, with reference to the cultivated
soil, is denser to the square mile than that of China; created
solely by agriculture, with none of those sources of wealth
which are developed with civilisation, and sustained, consequently,
on the lowest conceivable diet; so that, in case of
failure, they have no other means of subsistence upon which
they can fall back. That dense population in extreme distress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
inhabit an island where there is an Established Church which
is not their Church, and a territorial aristocracy, the richest
of whom live in distant capitals. Thus you have a starving
population, an absentee aristocracy, and an alien Church;
<em>and, in addition, the weakest executive in the world</em>. That is
the Irish question. What were the remedies?</p>

<p>“To begin with, and before anything else, you must have
a representative, a responsive, a <em>strong</em> Executive. Ireland
is an exceptional piece of the United Kingdom, and she
alone demands what is foreign to the English spirit—<em>centralisation</em>
of government. Next, the administration must be
<em>impartial</em>. There must be no exclusion and no favouritism.
You must also have <em>ecclesiastical equality</em>. The Church in
Ireland must change the tone of its temper. And you must
‘<em>reconstruct</em> the social system’ of Ireland. ‘All great things
are difficult;’ but it is more difficult to reconstruct a society
than a party. Agitation only unsettles: it does not settle;
and it means the incompetence of a Government. You must
‘create public opinion instead of following it; lead the public
instead of always lagging after and watching others.’</p>

<p>“... What, then, is the duty of an English minister? <em>To
effect by his policy all those changes which a revolution would do
by force....</em> It is quite evident that, to effect this, we must
have an Executive in Ireland which shall bear <em>a much nearer
relation to the leading classes and characters</em> of the country than
it does at present. There must be a much more <em>comprehensive</em>
Executive, and then, having produced order, the rest is a
question of time. There is no possible way by which the
physical condition of the people can be improved by Act of
Parliament.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>So I read this pregnant deliverance. So, I believe, will
read it any one who scans it closely in relation to its time
and setting. In 1868, when there was capital to be made out
of it, Mr. Gladstone did not so read it. Mr. Gladstone contended—and
he had full right to contend—that, with regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
to the Church, at any rate, it spelled out “Destruction.”
Disraeli contented himself with retorting: “... There are
many remarks which, if I wanted to vindicate ... myself, I
might legitimately make.... But I do not care to say it,
and I do not wish to say it, because in my conscience the
<em>sentiment of that speech was right</em>....” My view is that it
spelled out “Reconstruction.” It would have settled Ireland
and the Irish question by the principles of 1636 and on the
lines of 1792, and not either by the Orange lodges of 1795,
which answered Pitt’s abortive schemes of improvement, or
by the undemanded spoliation of 1868, which trebled the
discontent it designed to allay. All Pitt’s proposed measures
were against <em>exclusion</em>. He tried to grant Ireland that free
outlet for her manufactures to England which had proved her
main source of discontent throughout the eighteenth century.
He tried to include the Protestant Dissenters as well as the
Roman Catholics in the avenues to political power. He was
foiled by the selfishness and corruption of an Irish caste, and
by the spread of the French Revolution to the Irish multitude.
But in each case <em>inclusion</em> was his principle; development,
not destruction. Disraeli followed him. It was his hatred
of exclusiveness that prompted his aversion alike to the
Whiggism of the Grenvilles and the Toryism of Eldon. It
was his devotion to wide and popular as opposed to democratic
and class principles that drew him to the Toryism of Bolingbroke
and Wyndham, and enabled him to reconstruct the Tory
party on its first but forgotten foundations.</p>

<p>But if we want a practical comment on the speech of
1844, we have it in an utterance of 1868. In 1868 he defined
the position: “... I said the other night, as I say now, that
I think you might elevate the <em>status</em> of the unendowed clergy
in Ireland.... My opinion is, that if this system of conciliation,
founded on the principle that in Ireland <em>you ought to
create and not destroy</em>, had been pursued, you might have
elevated the Irish Church greatly to its advantage. You
might have rendered it infinitely more useful.... I do not
think it impossible that you might have introduced measures
which would have elevated the <em>status</em> of the unendowed
clergy, and so softened and terminated those feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
inequality which now exist, <em>so that you might have had the
same equality in the state of Ireland which you have in England</em>.
There is perfect equality in the state of the Dissenter in
England, although his is no established Church. That state
of things might exist in Ireland, if you had taken measures
which would, among a sensitive people, have prevented a
sentiment of humiliation.... Without disestablishment,
without the difficulties and dangers of concurrent endowment,
there might have been a system of Government grants both
to Romanists and Dissenters for education and other public
objects. That is how I interpret the ‘ecclesiastical equality’
of 1844; ‘to create and not to destroy.’”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> And, speaking
again of his desire to supplement the educational means for
the Roman Catholics, he said: “... That is in accordance
with our uniform policy, ... a reconciliation between creeds
and classes.”</p>

<p>After 1844 the Irish question still festered. Nowhere did
the repeal of the Corn Laws inflict more immediate distress
than in a country so dependent on native agriculture as
Ireland was then and still remains. Pauperism became the
crying evil of Ireland. Even in 1869, more than a quarter
of the inhabitants were paupers. Pauperism defied “political
palliatives.” The Government of Ireland, despite his warnings,
remained a weak one, and, alluding to this in a famous speech
of 1869, he pertinently brought into prominence the fact that
what strength it has depends now on its connection with
England. “... The Government of Ireland is not a strong
one; its sanctions are less valid than those of the Government
of England. It has not the historic basis which England
rests upon. It has not the tradition which the English
Government rests upon. It does not depend upon that vast
accumulation of manners and customs which in England are
really more powerful than laws or statutes.” What Disraeli
felt all along was that Ireland needed security for capital
and variety of employment; and that for these repose and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
order were requisite. In November, 1868, alluding to the
naturalisation of Fenianism in Ireland at a time when Ireland
was inherently contented and immeasurably superior to her
plight in 1844—when she had begun to rest and be thankful—he
made the following <span class="locked">comment:—</span></p>

<p>“... In Ireland there was always a degree of morbid
discontent which the Fenians believe they may fan into flame,
and which might lead to the revolutionary result they desire.
The whole nature of the race will account for it. An Irishman
is an imaginative being. He lives in an island, in
a damp climate and contiguous to the melancholy ocean.
<em>He has no variety of pursuit.</em> There is no nation in the
world that leads so monotonous a life as the Irish, because
<em>their only occupation is the cultivation of the soil before them</em>....
The Irishman in other countries, <em>where he has a fair field
for his talents in various occupations, is equal, if not superior,
to most races</em>.... I may say with frankness that I think
this is the fault of the Irish. If they led that kind of life
which would invite the introduction of capital into the country,
all this ability might be utilised; and instead of those feelings
which they acquire by brooding over the history of their
country, a great part of which is merely traditionary, you
would find men acquiring fortunes, and arriving at conclusions
on politics entirely different from those which they now
offer.”</p>

<p>The same outlook prompted him in another speech to
regret the cry of a “conquered people” which the manipulators
of grievance perpetually raised. Ireland was no more
a conquered country than England. In both there had been
conquerors and conquests;<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> but in both a blend of races and
institutions which had produced a nation in one, and made
for nationality in the other.</p>

<p>Time went on. Ireland had improved by rest. There
was even prosperity in her borders. Fenianism was subsiding.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>
Classes were less estranged. Emigration had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
increased, but the Liberals welcomed emigration. Disraeli
had risen into supreme power, and had constitutionalised the
democracy by his Bill of 1867. The Radicals were incensed
at the measure, which they had coveted in another form and
with sectional objects. The stiffer even of his own party
stood aghast, and some seceded. The Liberals began to
nibble at the Radical bait. It is a curious fact that the
Whigs, when in political despair, usually resort to a revolutionary
measure. Already, over thirty years before, they
had done so in connection with Ireland. Suddenly, without
warning, without a popular mandate, or even an Irish outcry
for the upheaval, like a bolt from the blue came Mr.
Gladstone’s first great conversion from principles firmly
protested only a year before.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> The question was sprung
on both countries. He brought in, and in a manner so
imperious that a solid portion of his own followers deserted
him, his Act for the Disestablishment and Disendowment of
the Irish Church; not only for its severance from the State,
but for its spoliation by the State.</p>

<p>In the abstract its disestablishment, apart from its disendowment,
was a great, a just, and a generous measure;
theoretically it was as sound as bimetallism. But its logical
issues were incompatible with a united kingdom. They
really, on examination, involved that separatist theory of the
“right” of “nationalities” to be self-governing, of which he
grew so fond. “Nationality” is here a wrong expression, for
“nationality” is, by its essence, a term of union, and not of
division. It should be “Locality.” What is meant by this
assumed “right” is, that particular races or particular provinces,
absorbed into or dependent on “nationalities,” are
entitled, from the mere fact of their geographical limits, to
withdraw from the greater whole of which they are portions.
This theory would revive the Heptarchy. It would make
Jersey and Guernsey, or the Isle of Man, it would make Scotland
or Wales, a “nation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
I say that Mr. Gladstone’s measure, introduced when
and how it was, and with its double purport, involved these
conclusions, because if the mere existence of an “alien Church”
justifies the severance of the ties between authority and
religion, and the plunder of its revenues for purposes other
than that for which they were created, then the same reasoning
would not only justify the abolition of an alien and the
substitution of a native government, but also a refusal to
contribute any revenue to the deposed government at all.
There might be occasions demanding such a course. An
oppressive Church, a tyrannical government, might well be
swept away by a statesman with ears to hear the cries of
impatience and eyes to see the ravages of injustice—a true
statesman who, as Disraeli said in 1844, would accomplish by
statute and conciliation what revolutions necessitate by force.</p>

<p>But this was not one of them. The English Church itself
was not practically resented, however its historical existence
might be made to rankle in common with the other historical
anomalies in Ireland, including its connection with England.
The Church itself had been bettered, and might be still more
improved. It was alive with opportunities. The Catholics
and the Dissenters might, apart from the Establishment, which
stood for British authority, be set upon a complete equality,
and helped towards usefulness in many directions. The Church
itself had proved a valuable educational centre. The Roman
clergy called, not for its extinction, but for its disendowment;
and rather because they could not bear to think that it was
there at all, just as they cannot bear to think that it exists in
England, than because they wanted the revenues or suffered
under the rebuffs or rivalry of an English Church. It was
an argument, as Disraeli put it, that might be paralleled if all
those Irish gentlemen who had small estates, but frequented
the same society, were to say that their brethren of large
estates should surrender their revenues to the State; or if
the unendowed hospitals of London were to exact the deprival
of the endowments enjoyed by St. Bartholomew’s,
St. Thomas’s, and Guy’s, not with the object of themselves
sharing them, but out of wanton envy.</p>

<p>Disraeli delivered three main speeches of great power,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
interest, and length on this subject. I shall not quote them
in words, but shall only endeavour to present their pith.</p>

<p>As regards the <em>Disestablishment</em>.</p>

<p>He objected to it on principle—the principles outlined in
my second chapter. The union of Church and State is a
symbol of the Divine nature of government, which is the
only truth underlying the obsolete fiction of the “Divine
Right of Kings.” He objected to it on policy. Divorce the
religious principle from that of government, and it is the
State that will suffer most. The result must be disorder.
One day that might take a peculiar form. The political
power once separated from the spiritual, a crisis might arise
where the two might collide; and where, though the political
power might be right, the spiritual would appeal in haste to
both passion and prejudice.</p>

<p>As regards the <em>Disendowment</em>.</p>

<p>He objected to it on principle. The plunder of public
corporations was nothing new, but where the trust for which
the corporation had been endowed was not observed in the
application of the spoil by the State, which was a trustee, it
was indefensible. It became confiscation. “Irish purposes”
were vaguely hinted as the destination, but the repeal of the
whisky duty might be an “Irish purpose;” and where was
the sense of dedicating some of this annexed property to
Irish pauper lunatics? Moreover, historically, he had always
noticed that the spoil of the Church went eventually to enrich
the large landed proprietors.</p>

<p>He objected to it on policy. One of the causes of discontent
was alleged to be that a particular Church was not
connected with the State. Mr. Gladstone proposed to
regenerate the country by having <em>three</em> Churches not connected
with the State. Discontent, however, would still
remain smouldering, and Disraeli prophesied that its next
phase would threaten the tenure of land. What would
be the effect in this relation of having three Churches
disconnected from the State? The land question would, he
predicted, assume many threatening forms with one purpose—a
purpose against the rights and the duties of property.
One Church was to be deprived of property which none of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
the others claimed. Three sets of clergy were to be equally
apart from the State. A class in the first place, therefore,
and that a class of resident proprietors, was to be destroyed;
when it was agreed that one of the evils in Ireland was the
want of a variety of classes and of resident proprietors. In
the second, one of the avowed evils, the curse of Ireland, was
poverty; but here was an Act to confiscate property, and
that property in its nature popular—the appanage of the
people.</p>

<p>When the land question should arise, there might ensue
a triple danger, that of three sets of clergy divided in
theology and matters of discipline, but united in discontent;
and the three might eventually demand the restoration of the
national property; and if it were refused, there might be
revolution. England could afford no more revolutions. But,
in any case, the spoliation of the Protestant clergy would
breed jealousies among themselves also; for they were
actually invited and induced (by means which he exposed)
to co-operate in their own expropriation. The plunder of the
Catholic clergy had bred great discontent. The plunder of
the Protestant clergy would do the same. And if discontent
were left to grow as it went, the land outcry would produce
others, and they again others in their turn and train. There
would be no rest, no finality. It would be discontent without
end.</p>

<p>Far more than this, however, he objected to the ultimate
consequences of this revolutionary departure. Confiscation
was contagious. What was now applied—and applied in a
form aggravated by its complications—to the national property,
might one day be applied to private property. What
was now applied to Ireland might one day be forcibly
applied to England. If the public disaster of the disestablishment
and disendowment of the English Church ever
took place, in deference to the jealousy of a class and not
because of its own inherent decay as a great civil and
ecclesiastical institution, it would be aided by the precedent
of Ireland.</p>

<p>Such is the pith, though many of the details and much of
the historical criticism are omitted; nor have I here dealt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
with the Maynooth and “Regium Donum” problems and
their bearings on these matters, which Disraeli discussed in
full. But I have condensed enough to point the path of his
ideas.</p>

<p>Not all these dismal forebodings have yet been realised;
but many of them, unfortunately, came to pass. Ireland’s
discontent, Catholic discontent, were, neither of them, allayed
by the disestablishment and disendowment of the Protestant
Church. The clergy of that Church are still far from contented.
The land question burst out within a brief space of Disraeli’s
prediction. It brought with it a long and fatal series of
cumulative troubles; and, as Disraeli had also predicted, the
actual rights of civil property, the rights of civilised society,
became invaded. “Compensation for disturbance” asserted
the right to pay no rent. For a time the last state of Ireland
was almost worse than the first. There were “months of
murder, incendiarism, and every conceivable outrage.” “The
Executive absolutely abandoned their functions.” Disraeli’s
last trumpet-call was to warn the country, in his celebrated
letter to the Lord-Lieutenant, that there were those who
wished to sever Ireland from England as part of a scheme
for the disruption of the Empire. In 1881 he adverted to
that warning.</p>

<p>“... Now what was the consequence of that declaration?
The present Government took an early opportunity soon after
I had made that declaration, to express a contrary opinion.
They said there was in Ireland an absence of crime and
outrage, with a general sense of comfort and satisfaction....
I warned the constituencies that there was going on in Ireland
a conspiracy which aimed at the disunion of the two countries,
and probably at something more. I said that if they were
not careful something might happen almost as bad as pestilence
and famine.... My observations, of course, were
treated with that ridicule which a successful election always
secures....”</p>

<p>We all know the rest. The country was only saved by a
secession of the light and leading of the Liberal party from
their rash and misguided leader. Wisdom has been justified
of her child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
In conclusion, let me say that none would have welcomed
more gratefully than Disraeli the statesmanlike effort to
settle the land question which has recently made England
the landlord of Ireland. He might have descried in it
elements of difficulty, and even of some danger for the future.
But it would, in the main, I am confident, have received his
unstinted support; for it is founded on the rock of conciliation—on
Disraeli’s policy “<em>To create and not to destroy</em>.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Macaulay</span> observes of Frances Burney that “while
still a girl she had laid up such a store of materials
for fiction as few of those who mix much in the
world are able to accumulate during a long life.
She had watched and listened to people of every class, from
princes and great officers of State, down to artists living in
garrets and poets familiar with subterranean cook-shops.
Hundreds of remarkable persons had passed in review before
her—English, French, German, Italian, lords and fiddlers,
deans of cathedrals and managers of theatres, travellers
leading about newly caught savages, and singing women
escorted by deputy husbands.”</p>

<p>This is true of Disraeli. Long before he entered public
life, before he knew the inimitable D’Orsay, or even the
luminous Lyndhurst, before his most happy marriage, he had
entered society at both doors—the gate of horn and the gate
of ivory. As a stripling of twenty he had been sent, as we have
seen, by Murray, the founder of his own fortune on Byron’s
fortune and misfortunes, to Abbotsford and Sir Walter Scott.
The young Disraeli used to dub Murray “the Emperor.”
Murray described him as the most remarkable young man
he had ever met; “a deep thinker but thoroughly practical
in his ideas,” at once brilliant and solid, of a bright and airy
disposition which endeared him to the young, and, himself
unspoilt as “a child;” singularly happy in his home
relations, and “his father is my oldest friend.” That father
was himself a singular and remarkable man, who had attracted
a distinguished coterie. He was Pye’s early intimate and
Thomas Baring’s friend. His ties with Penn cemented his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
love of Buckinghamshire. He was familiar with Southey, and
he knew Mrs. Siddons. He conversed with Samuel Rogers<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>
and Tom Moore; he had corresponded and dined with
Byron, of whom “Disraeli the Younger” has recorded some
striking traits. He knew all the men of quills and letters,
including the antiquarian Bliss and Douce, many of the wits,
and some of the “wit-woulds.” His own brother-in-law,
George Basevi, was an eminent architect,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> and architecture
is often touched in the son’s novels.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> Another member
of the family was a conveyancer, and through him the
son was first sent to read law with a solicitor, in whose
office he read Chaucer, and was then entered at Lincoln’s
Inn. He had artistic acquaintances also. Barry, he knew
well. Downman painted his wife, and Downman’s brother was
his associate. And there were also some men of affairs who
visited Isaac Disraeli’s house. The burrowing and irrepressible
Croker, afterwards so mercilessly satirised as “Rigby,”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>
and equally trounced, poor man, by Thackeray and Macaulay,
seems to have been his occasional purveyor of politics. But
for contemporary parties he cared little. He was a solitary
student of the past; excavating ancient manuscripts in the
British Museum when the daily number of such scholars did
not exceed six. He was shy, meditative, dreamy, and dispassionate.
But he was poet besides recluse; his earliest courtship,
while Dr. Johnson lay dying, had been that of the muse.
Sir Walter Scott included one of his lyrics in a published
collection.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> He diversified his stern by lighter labours, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
his novels, long since moldered, caused some stir and attracted
sympathy. After the romance of his early failures and the
surprise of his early success, he set himself patiently down to
work for ten years before he would print another line. His
own father, who never understood but always humored him,
was a man of business, sanguine and prompt, yet gay and
nonchalant, who lost fortunes and regained them.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Disraeli
the Younger united the two strains of his father and of his
grandfather. He was a practical dreamer.</p>

<p>Isaac Disraeli, then, gave his boy an opening to the
literary world. Among his intimates was the shrewd solicitor,
Mr. Austin, and his clever young wife, a literary coquette of
talent, the aunt of the future Sir Henry Layard, the transcriber
of <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>. Her salon was frequented, among
others, by the Hooks<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> and the Mathews. With the
Austins young Disraeli journeyed in Italy and Germany.
From his father’s library he thus emerged on a larger world.
But he soon outstepped its bounds. After his long Eastern
travels with Clay, and Meredith<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> affianced to Disraeli’s sister—a
voyage on which Byron’s Tita became Disraeli’s valet, and
on which he encountered the most opposite types as well as
some curious adventures<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>—his own first books made him the
lion of several seasons. He and Bulwer divided the honors
of Bath, then still fashionable. Lyndhurst grew to depend on
his assistance, and even advice; Disraeli escorted him when
as Chancellor he was present at Kensington at the accession
of Queen Victoria; Lyndhurst’s daughter became an associate
of Disraeli’s sister; and nothing gave Disraeli more unfeigned
pleasure than the visits of Lyndhurst and Bulwer to his father
at Bradenham.</p>

<p>He not only wrote novels, pamphlets, and sonnets (his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
vain ambition was to revolutionise poetry), but he seems to
have contributed to the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> as well as to
many magazines. In 1833, as has been noticed, he corresponded
with its editor, Napier, with a view to a “slasher”
on Morier’s “Zohrab,” which had been puffed in the <cite>Quarterly</cite>.
Of the book he remarks, “A production in every respect
more contemptible I have seldom met with;” and of the
puff, “This is what comes of putting a tenth-rate novelist at
the head of a great critical journal.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>Then followed Gore House, with its high Bohemian wits,
its low Bohemian buffoons, its loose celebrities, its “man of
destiny,” Louis Napoleon; its laughter and its tears; its
Watteau-like <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parterres</i>, and the generous, erring Egeria of
the grot.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> Then, too, came that fascinating circle of the
Sheridans, which united sparkling talent to entrancing beauty
in extraordinary charm. But then also came the duller round
of High Mayfair—the Londonderrys and the Buckinghams.
Among diplomatists at this period he knew Pozzo. He had
seen, or met, or known the fathers or grandfathers of most of
the aristocracy which, forty years afterwards, he was to lead.
Resolved from the first, as he said in an early letter, “to
respect himself, the only way to make others respect you;”
an outrageous dandy; sometimes in deplored debt, often in
surmounted scrapes, always in good humour, he had surveyed
the whole kaleidoscope of society, artificial as well as
natural, before, or soon after, he turned thirty years of age;
from the pachas and intriguers of the East, to the leaders and
amusers of the West; from Ali and the governors, admirals, and
garrisons of Malta and Gibraltar, to solemn busy-bodies in
and out of place; the fops and flutterers in and out of society;
men famous who were destined to obscurity, men obscure who
were vowed to fame; eccentrics and platitudinarians; the
Upper Ten—“the two thousand Brahmins who constitute the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
world”—and the lower ten thousand; from the eccentric
Urquhart to “L.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;L.,” “the Sappho of Brompton,” and, it
would seem, Davison the future musical critic. An early
letter, probably addressed to him, lies before me. It may be
of passing interest to subjoin <span class="locked">it:—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“<span class="smcap">My dear Davison</span>,

<p class="let">“I am very vexed that I missed you this morning.

<p>“I am alone, as Ossian says, but luckily not upon the

<p>“Instead of that catch-cold situation, a good fireside will

<p>“Mind you come.</p>

<p class="sigright">

</p>

<p>“Excuse scrawl, etc. 6 o’clock.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The society of those days still retained much of the
Regency’s tinsel. It glittered far more than it shone. Society
was not then quite the Dresden china shop with porcelain
figures of beaux and boxers, of topers and bull-dogs, of satyrs
and nymphs, of city swains and simpering shepherdesses,
that it had been ten or fifteen years before. Byron, with his
savage sincerity, may be said to have dashed that smooth
farrago to fragments. But it remained a society of veneer
and affectation. It was a less natural age than our own, with
fewer ideals and less outward movement. It was a more
boisterous age than our own; public opinion exercised far less
pressure. It was at once a coarser, a more sentimental and a
more romantic, if a more bombastic age than ours. There
still lingered the curiosity of Dr. Johnson’s age for the tittle-tattle
of voyagers and the curiosities of barbarism. But it
was not in the main a more material age, or, under the
surface, a much more selfish one. Sympathy was local then.
“The people were only half born.” It was, however, certainly
a generation far more fastidious and exclusive; and at the
same time it was certainly more appreciative of genius. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
could then appeal to the few where you cannot now appeal to
the many; for the few then had neither the narrowness of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> nor the unlimited appetite of the million.</p>

<p>“The invention,” smiles Disraeli so early as in his mock-classical
squib, <cite>The Infernal Marriage</cite>, “by Jupiter of an
aristocratic immortality, as a reward for a well-spent life on
earth, appears to me to have been a very ingenious idea. It
really is a reward very stimulative of good conduct before we
shuffle off this mortal coil, and remarkably contrasts with the
democracy of the damned. The Elysians, with a splendid
climate, a teeming soil, and a nation made on purpose to wait
upon them, of course enjoyed themselves very much....
The Elysians, indeed, being highly refined and gifted ...
were naturally a very liberal-minded race and very capable of
appreciating every kind of excellence. If a gnome, or a
sylph, therefore, in any way distinguished themselves, ...
aye! indeed, if the poor devils could do nothing better than
write a poem or a novel, they were sure to be noticed by the
Elysians, who always bowed to them as they passed by, and
sometimes, indeed, even admitted them into their circles.”</p>

<p>What Disraeli detested was what he termed, even in
<cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, “<em>society on anti-social principles</em>.” What he liked
was a distinct and distinctive circle, interchanging its
ideas—“free trade in conversation.” In his social, as in his
political outlook, he craved inclusiveness on the basis of
excellence, and not either the restrictedness of a caste or the
miscellany of a multitude. In this sense all society should be
“aristocratic.” And he always felt that, as a rule, it was
precisely the middle-class element, contrasted either with
those who inherited the finer perceptions of breeding or
with those—the gallery—born with perceptive instincts—that
is in the main deficient in these respects. “... The stockbrokers’
ladies took off the quarto travels and the hot-pressed
poetry. They were the patronesses of your patent ink and
your wire-wove paper. That is all past....”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> What he
disrelished was the meaner sort of mediocrity, except when it
was unassuming and useful.</p>

<p>“High breeding and a good heart,” he demands in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
<cite>Lothair</cite> for the “perfect host.” “To throw over a host,” he
has also written, “is the most heinous of social crimes. It
ought never to be pardoned....” “... She, too,” he says
of the Duchess in <cite>Coningsby</cite>—who “was one of the delights of
existence,”—“was distinguished by that perfect good breeding
which is the result of nature and not of education; for it may
be found in a cottage and may be missed in a palace. ’Tis
a genial regard for the feelings of others that springs from the
absence of selfishness.... Nothing in the world could have
induced her to appear bored when another was addressing
or attempting to amuse her. She was not one of those vulgar
fine ladies who meet you one day with a vacant stare, as if
unconscious of your existence, and address you on another in
a tone of impertinent familiarity.” “This is a lesson for you
fine ladies,” says “Egremont” in <cite>Sybil</cite>, “who think you can
govern the world by what you call your social influences;
asking people once or twice a year to an inconvenient crowd
in your house; now haughtily smirking, and now impertinently
staring at them, and flattering yourselves all this time that to
have the occasional privilege of entering your saloons, and the
periodical experience of your insolent recognition, is to be a
reward for great exertions, or, if necessary, an inducement
to infamous tergiversation.” And, indeed, the “Zenobia” of
<cite>Endymion</cite>, who was Lady Jersey, did sometimes condescend
to practise these shifts of political ambition.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> But in high
society with low standards, there were worse depths than
the backstairs patronage of party recruits. “Never,” as
the fine sentence prefixed to <cite>Sybil</cite> recalls, “were so many
gentlemen, and so little gentleness.” The contemptuous
materialism of “Monmouth House,” the elegant indifference
of “Lord Eskdale,” around which revolve the satellites and
parasites, social and political—the folks that made Selwyn
exclaim when a great nobleman’s golden dinner-service was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
up to auction—“Lord, how many toads have eaten off this
plate!”</p>

<p>“Among the habitual dwellers” (this from <cite>Coningsby</cite>) “in
these delicate halls there was a tacit understanding, a prevalent
doctrine, that required no formal exposition, no proofs
and illustrations, no comment, and no gloss, which was,
indeed, rather a traditional conviction than an impartial
dogma—that the exoteric public were, on many subjects, the
victims of very vulgar prejudice, which these enlightened
personages wished neither to disturb nor to adopt.” “Society,”
he said, alluding to its treatment of Byron in <cite>Venetia</cite>, “is
all passions and no heart.” In <cite>Vivian Grey</cite> (as to the circumstances
of which I shall say something in my last chapter) the
father (that is, Disraeli’s father) thus admonishes the boyish son.</p>

<p>“... You are now inspecting one of the worst portions
of society in what is called the great world (St. Giles’ is bad,
but of another kind), and it may be useful, on the principle
that the actual sight of brutal ebriety was supposed to have
inspired youth with the virtue of temperance.... Let me
warn you not to fall into the usual error of youth, in fancying
that the circle you move in is precisely the world itself. Do
not imagine that there are not other beings, whose benevolent
principle is governed by finer sympathies, and by those nobler
emotions which really constitute all our public and private
virtues. I give you this hint, lest, in your present society,
you might suppose these virtues were merely historical.”
Speaking of “Vivian Grey” under the guise of “Contarini
Fleming’s” first novel, Disraeli makes his hero ejaculate:
“All the bitterness of my heart, occasioned by my wretched
existence among their false circles, found its full vent. Never
was anything so imprudent. Everybody figured, and all
parties and opinions alike suffered.” Still more did he
despise “the insolence of the insignificant.”</p>

<p>What he admired in whatever form—even when incompatible
with society—was purpose with personality. This is
manifest in all his early novels, conspicuous in his later ones.
The two heroes of <cite>Venetia</cite>—Byron and Shelley<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>—are portrayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
from this point of view. Even the hysterical purpose of Lady
Caroline Lamb in the person of “Lady Monteagle” is recognised;
and of Byron he causes his characters to speak in
<cite>Vivian Grey</cite>: “There was the man! And that such a man
should be lost to us at the very moment that he had begun
to discover why it had pleased the Omnipotent to have
endowed him with such powers!”—“If one thing were more
characteristic of Byron’s mind than another, it was his strong,
shrewd common sense, his pure, unadulterated sagacity.”—“The
loss of Byron can never be retrieved. He was indeed
a real man; and, when I say this, I award him the most
splendid character which human nature need aspire to.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
The very intellectual purpose of comparative purposelessness,
of dilettante taste, attracted him. This is how he addresses
“Luttrell” in <cite>The Young Duke</cite>: “... Teach us that wealth
is not elegance, that profusion is not magnificence, and that
splendour is not heart. Teach us that taste is a talisman
which can do greater wonders than the millions of the loan-monger.
Teach us that to vie is not to rival; and to imitate
not to invent. Teach us that pretension is a bore. Teach us
that wit is excessively good-natured, and, like champagne,
not only sparkles, but is sweet.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> Teach us the vulgarity of
malignity. Teach us that envy spoils our complexions, and
that anxiety destroys our figure. Catch the fleeting colours
of that sly chameleon, Cant, and show what excessive trouble
we are ever taking to make ourselves miserable and silly.
Teach us all this, and Aglaia shall stop a crow in its course,
and present you with a pen, Thalia hold the golden fluid
in a Sévres vase, and Euphrosyne support the violet-coloured
scroll.”</p>

<p>So, too, the energetic personality of D’Orsay aroused his
enthusiastic friendship, and drew from him, some twenty
years after that ambrosial figure had vanished, the tribute of
“... the most accomplished and the most engaging character
that has figured in this century, who, with the form and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
universal genius of an Alcibiades, combined a brilliant wit and
a heart of quick affection, and who, placed in a public position,
would have displayed a courage, a judgment, and a commanding
intelligence which would have ranked him among
the leaders of mankind.” D’Orsay speaks and acts to the life
as “Count Mirabel” in <cite>The Young Duke</cite>. And, in a too
unfamiliar passage of <cite>The Young Duke</cite>, he thus also embalms,
I fancy,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> the memory of Lady Blessington’s maligned charm
under the veil of “Lady Aphrodite.”</p>

<p>“... We are not of those who set themselves against
the verdict of society, or ever omit to expedite, by a gentle
kick, a falling friend. And yet, when we just remember
beauty is beauty, and grace is grace, and kindness is kindness,
although the beautiful, the graceful, and the amiable
do get in a scrape, we don’t know how it is, we confess
it is a weakness, but, under these circumstances, we do not
feel quite inclined to sneer. But this is wrong. We should
not pity or pardon those who have yielded to great
temptation, or, perchance, great provocation. Besides, it is
right that our sympathies should be kept for the injured.”
Endeavour and individuality he reverenced and recognised.
Tact, the charity of manners, he admired.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> But for aimlessness,
whether callous or random, whether patrician or
plebeian—whether of “Lord Marney,” who said to “Egremont,”
“I am your elder brother, sir, whose relationship to
you is your only claim to the consideration of society,” and
was answered, “A curse on the society that has fashioned
such claims ... founded on selfishness, cruelty, and fraud,
and leading to demoralisation, misery, and crime;” or of
“Rigby,” who called his record in Debrett of the marriage
successfully schemed for his patron, “a great fact.” To such as
these he gave no quarter; and he scalped them with a wit
and an irony that has rarely been equalled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
And he loved startling contrasts. “Whatever they did,”
he says in <cite>The Infernal Marriage</cite>, “the Elysians were careful
never to be vehement.” Disraeli liked to break the monotone
of society’s polished surface by pronounced and original types
of race, of class, of passion, of enterprise; the Roman among
the European-Americans, the Arabian, the Syrian, the Greek,
the Gaul among the Franks. He revelled in romantic women,
muses, or prophetesses, who lead forlorn movements, or rally
broken fortunes; in men whom they cheer and kindle; in
public spirits; in sudden and unexpected revolutions of
fortune, and sudden and unforeseen revelations of character.
To himself in his first youth might adhere the phrase with
which he then labelled “Popanilla:” “He looked the most
dandified of savages, and the most savage of dandies.” He
liked to pit the Bohemian against the noble, and the valet
against the hero; the “light children of dance and song”
against their heavy patrons; to display the power of career
even in the lodginghouse-keeper’s daughter; to depict the
aristocracy of the master working man; to analyse and
contrast the ironies of the struggle, the social tragedy of
illusion, and the social farce of fashion. “... ‘Your mind
is opening, Ixion,’” says Mercury, in that brilliant skit which
Disraeli penned before he was celebrated; “‘you will soon be
a man of the world. To the left, and keep clear of that star’—‘Who
lives there?’—‘The Fates know, not I. Some low
people who are trying to shine into notice. ’Tis a parvenu
planet, and only sprung up into space within this century.
We don’t visit them.’” “Sybil” herself, it should be remembered,
is an aristocrat born, but not bred, while half
“Egremont’s” Norman relations are cads or snobs.</p>

<p>He loved, too, society’s foibles—to hit off the precocious
wiseacres of the golden youth. “... A young fellow of two- or
three-and-twenty knows the world as men used to do after
as many years of scrapes. I wonder whether there is such a
thing as a greenhorn? Effie Crabbs says the reason he gives
up his house is that he has cleaned out the old generation, and
that the new generation would clean him.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> To banter “those
uncommonly able men who only want an opportunity,” the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
philosophers and the puppies; to jest, as he does in <cite>Popanilla</cite>,
at legal fictions; to poke fun at the “great orator, before a
green table, beating a red box,” or the prattlers on science
in “gilded saloons;” to depict the pyramidal selfishness
but unruffled pride of Lord Hertford in “Lord Monmouth”—Thackeray’s
“Lord Steyne;” to chronicle the pæan of
“Mrs. Guy Flouncey”—a precursor of “Becky Sharp”—when
she wins the invitation to the great house: “My dear, we
have done it at last!” or those whose <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">summum bonum</i> is to
have ten thousand a year and be thought to have five; or
those waiters on dying Mammon, who, when the will is
read, “all become orderly and broken-hearted;” or the
bored good humour of the Radical noble, who was almost a
Communist except as regarded land—“as if a fellow could
have too much land;” to burlesque the whole medley of blue
bores and bore-blues, of red-tape, and peas-on-drums, the
Jacks-in-office and the Jacks-in-boxes, of “nobs and snobs,”
of “statesmen, fiddlers, and buffoons.” But it should not be
forgotten that he ever kept a warm place in his heart for
sailors, whom he regarded as among the most natural and
delightful of mankind.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>It was not only the big shams and little follies of society
that revolted or amused him. He held, also, that melancholy
and dulness were social crimes. “If a man be gloomy, let
him keep to himself. No man has a right to go croaking
about society, or, what is worse, looking as if he stifled grief.
These fellows should be put in the pound. We like a good
broken heart or so now and then; but then one should retire
to the Sierra Morena mountains and live upon locusts and
wild honey, not dine out with our cracked cores....”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> And
among breaches of social tact, he most disliked those minor
monomanias which make the bore. “Never,” he once warned
a young man, “discuss ‘The Letters of Junius,’ or ‘The Man
in the Iron Mask.’” Some of his happiest conversations are
to be found in the <cite>Lothair</cite> colloquies at Muriel Towers.</p>

<p>Society used to depend on conversation much more than it
does now, when there is so much hurry, so much wealth, so
many amusements, so little privacy, and so much printed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
about it that practically there is no compact society at all—merely
a touring menagerie. Disraeli, in one of his earlier
novels,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> has an excellent essay in miniature on social
<span class="locked">conversation:—</span></p>

<p>“The high style of conversation where eloquence and
philosophy emulate each other, ... all this has ceased. It
ceased in this country with Johnson and Burke, and it requires
a Johnson and a Burke for its maintenance. There is no
mediocrity in such intercourse, no intermediate character
between the sage and the bore. The second style, where
men, not things, are the staple, but where wit and refinement
and sensibility invest even personal details with intellectual
interest, does flourish at present, as it always must in a highly
civilised society.... Then comes your conversation man,
who, we confess, is our aversion. His talk is a thing apart,
got up before he enters the company from whose conduct it
should grow out. He sits in the middle of a large table,
and, with a brazen voice, bawls out his anecdotes about Sir
Thomas or Sir Humphry, Lord Blank or Lady Blue. He
is incessant, yet not interesting; ever varying, yet always
monotonous. Even if we are amused, we are no more
grateful for the entertainment than we are to the lamp over
the table for the light which it universally sheds, and to yield
which it was obtained on purpose. <em>We are more gratified by
the slight conversation of one who is often silent, but who speaks
from his momentary feelings, than by all this hullabaloo.</em> Yet
this machine is generally a favourite piece of furniture with
the hostess. You may catch her eye, as he recounts some
adventure of the morning, which proves that he not only
belongs to every club, but goes to them, light up with
approbation; and then when the ladies withdraw, and the
female senate deliver their criticism on the late actors, she
will observe with a gratified smile to her <em>confidante</em>, that the
dinner went off well, and that Mr. Bellow was very strong
to-day. All this is horrid, and the whole affair is a delusion.
A variety of people are brought together, who all come as
late as possible, and retire as soon, merely to show that they
have other engagements. A dinner is prepared for them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
which is hurried over, in order that a certain number of dishes
should be—not tasted, but seen. And provided that there
is no moment that an absolute silence reigns; that, besides
the bustling of the servants, the clattering of the plates and
knives, a stray anecdote is told, which, if good, has been
heard before, and which, if new, is generally flat; provided
a certain number of certain names of people of consideration
are introduced, by which some stranger, for whom the party
is often secretly given, may learn the scale of civilisation of
which he this moment forms a part; provided the senators
do not steal out too soon to the House, and their wives to
another party—the hostess is congratulated on the success
of her entertainment.” He much preferred the conversation
of “Pinto,” whose raillery, unremembered, amused and
“flattered the self-love of those whom it seemed sportively
not to spare.... He was not an intellectual Crœsus, but his
pockets were full of sixpences.” But then, “Pinto” did not
quite belong to the lower social stratum above characterised.
That Disraeli had not altered his opinion of it after forty years’
immense and intimate experience is shown by the description
in <cite>Lothair</cite> of the “reception” of “Mrs. Putney Giles.” Not
that Disraeli by any means inclined to the “call-a-spade-a-spade”
view of conversation. To say all one thought, to
be rudely frank, would destroy social converse. “... As
Pinto says, if every man were straightforward in his opinions,
there would be no conversation. The fun of talk is to find
out what a man really thinks, and then contrast it with the
enormous lies he has been telling all dinner, and perhaps
all his life.” “Never argue,” he once wrote, “and, if controversy
arises, change the subject.” And he also recognised
that “talk to man about himself, and he will listen for hours.”
“All women are vain, some men are not.” He believed,
too, in the saying of Swift, that a community of ailments is
a fastener of friendship. Once when an intimate asked Lord
Beaconsfield what he did when his acquaintanceship was
claimed by many whose faces and names were unfamiliar,
but who professed to have known him in youth, he answered,
“I always say one thing—‘Quite so, quite so! <em>and how is
the old complaint?</em>’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
I have said that in his youth Disraeli had occasionally
been in debt.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> No one ever reprobated it more, though no
one, except Goldsmith and Sheridan, has also extracted more
humour out of it, as is attested by the episode of “Mr.
Levison” and the coals in <cite>Henrietta Temple</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> In this novel
he thus <span class="locked">moralises—</span></p>

<p>“If youth but knew the fatal misery that they are entailing
on themselves the moment they accept a pecuniary credit
to which they are not entitled, how they would start in
their career! how pale they would turn! how they would
tremble, and clasp their hands in agony at the precipice on
which they are disporting. Debt is the prolific mother of
folly and of crime; it taints the course of life in all its dreams.
Hence so many unhappy marriages, so many prostituted pens
and venal politicians. It hath a small beginning, but a giant’s
growth and strength. When we make the monster we make
our master, who haunts us at all hours, and shakes his whip
of scorpions forever in our sight. The slave hath no overseer
so severe. Faustus, when he signed the bond with blood,
did not secure a dream more terrific. But when we are young
we must enjoy ourselves. True; and there are few things
more gloomy than the recollection of a youth that has not
been enjoyed....”</p>

<p>He was never a gambler. One of the most striking
passages of <cite>Vivian Grey</cite> gives the story—which would make
a strong play—of a man in high place, led on by even noble
motives to game, until he sharped at play, and was rescued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
from disgrace by friendship; and in <cite>The Young Duke</cite> is the
thrilling romance of the career of the founder of Crockford’s.</p>

<p>The Macaronis were replaced by the Beaux; the Beaux
in their turn by the more florid Dandies; until, at last, in the
’seventies, appeared the “Swells,” the heavy, if grand, Blunderbores,
sworn to bachelor indulgence, who thought that “every
woman should marry, but no man,” the exception only being
if a girl sprang from “an affectionate family, with good
shooting and first-rate claret.” Disraeli was interested in
the “swells.” In a measure he had created them, because
he had reconciled the people to the nobles, and the “swell”
was a term embodying the people’s homage. But in this
phase Disraeli saw something comic and barbaric. “St.
Aldegonde,” himself a gigantic “swell,” could not bear the
“swells.” When he met them he described them as “a social
jungle in which there was a great herd of animals.”</p>

<p>And with the “swells” began something of that “free-and-easiness”
which hails from modern Columbia, and has
now leavened society with its licence and its slang. “Free-and-easiness
is all very well,” once laughed Disraeli to a
friend, “but why not be a little freer and a little less easy?”
“His spirit,” he says of “Coningsby,” “recoiled from that gross
familiarity that is the characteristic of modern manners, and
which would destroy all forms and ceremonies, merely because
they curb and control their own coarse convenience and ill-disguised
selfishness.” With the “swells” came also another
social change—the diffusion not only of wealth, but of taste.
A great lady assures “Lothair” that he will be surprised to
see so many well-dressed and good-looking people at the
opera, that he never beheld before.</p>

<p>Political society pervades all Disraeli’s novels. Only two
phases of it need here be mentioned. The tiny coteries who
dine together twice a week and “think themselves a party.”
They appear in <cite>Sybil</cite>; they reappear in <cite>Endymion</cite>. And the
breakfast gatherings of the ’forties, peculiar, as Disraeli noted,
to Liberals. “It shows a restless, revolutionary mind,” mocks
“Lady Firebrace,” “that can settle to nothing, but must be
running after gossip the moment they are awake.” But two sayings,
not directly with regard to society, may in this connection,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
however, be recorded. Both are from <cite>The Young Duke</cite>.
“... He was always offended and always offending. Such
a man could never succeed as a politician—a character who,
of all others, must learn to endure, to forget, and to forgive.”
The second was prophetic: “One thing is clear—that a man
may speak very well in the House of Commons and fail very
completely in the House of Lords. There are two distinct
styles requisite. I intend in the course of my career, if I
have time, to give a specimen of both. In the Lower House,
‘Don Juan’ may perhaps be our model; in the Upper House,
‘Paradise Lost.’”</p>

<p>As for club existence, the “lounging, languid men who
spend their time in crossing from Brooks’s to Boodle’s and
from Boodle’s to Brooks’s,” has he not characterised “those
middle-aged nameless gentlemen of easy circumstances, who
haunt clubs and dine a great deal at each others’ houses and
chambers; men who travel regularly a little, and gossip
regularly a great deal; who lead a sort of facile, slipshod
existence, doing nothing, yet mightily interested in what
others do; <em>great critics of little things</em> ... peering through
the window of a club-house as if they were discovering a
planet”? And as for civic hospitality, he sums it up best,
perhaps, in the <cite>Endymion</cite> epigram: “Turtle makes all men
equal.”</p>

<p>He felt all along that, after all, true society is at home,
and not with “polished ruffians;” the “courtesy of the
heart” was preferable to that “of the head.” “My idea
of perfect society,” says “Lothair,” “is being married, as
I propose, and paying visits to Brentham;” or, as Disraeli
varies the theme in the same novel, “I am fond of society
that pleases me, that is accomplished and natural and ingenious;
otherwise I prefer being alone.” Home, he thought,
should be the centre of society, and a homeless society was
not one at all. It is very noticeable, in comparing present
with past fiction, how the English sense of home and flicker
of the fireside, which used to warm every page, has receded
out of view before the motor-speed and nervous restlessness of
the age. His home-fondness was touchingly displayed after
the death of his wife by his reply to a friend, who asked if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
were driving home—a reply accompanied by tears; “Home!
I have no home <em>now</em>.” Nor did any great man ever reserve
the sanctities of the hearth more completely from a prying
public. The purity of his home affections was one of Mr.
Gladstone’s notes of eulogy in the funeral oration that he
delivered in the House to which Disraeli had been proudly
devoted for forty-five long years. There are scores of sayings
and episodes in his books, from <cite>Vivian Grey</cite> downwards,
regarding the home affections; many charming touches, too,
in his letters to his sister. But I content myself with one,
from <cite>Venetia</cite>—</p>

<p>“... After all, we have no friends that we can depend
upon in this life but our parents.... All other intimacies,
however ardent, are liable to cool; all other confidence, however
limited, to be violated. In the phantasmagoria of life,
the friend with whom we have cultivated mutual trust for
years is often suddenly or gradually estranged from us, or
becomes, from painful yet irresistible circumstances, even our
deadliest foe. As for women ... the mistresses of our
hearts, who has not learnt that the links of passion are fragile
as they are glittering?... Where is the enamoured face that
smiled upon our early love, and was to shed tears over our
grave?... No wonder we grow callous, for how few have the
opportunity of returning to the hearth which they quitted in
levity or thoughtless weariness, yet which alone is faithful to
them; whose sweet affections require not the stimulus of
prosperity or fame, the lure of accomplishments or the tribute
of flattery, but which are constant to us in distress, and console
us even in disgrace!”</p>

<p>I ought, perhaps, to add a word of Disraeli’s ideas on love
and marriage. No one set more store by, or laid more store
on, the deciding influence of woman on man’s career. No
one recognised more heartily a woman’s instinctive superiority
to logic. How good is the humour in that dressing-room
scene of the ’seventies in <cite>Lothair</cite>:—</p>

<p>“... The gentlemen of the smoking-room have it not all
their own way quite as much as they think. If, indeed, a new
school of Athens were to be pictured, the sages and the
students might be represented in exquisite dressing-gowns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
with slippers rarer than the lost one of Cinderella, and
brandishing beautiful brushes over tresses still more fair.
Then is the time when characters are never more finely drawn,
or difficult social questions more accurately solved; knowledge
without reasoning, and truth without logic—the triumph of intuition!
But we must not profane the mysteries of Bona Dea.”</p>

<p>To women, moreover, he, like “Coningsby,” “instinctively
bowed as to beings set apart for reverence and delicate treatment,”
but disillusions chequered his experience. In maturity
he could undoubtedly “conceive that there were any other
women in the world than fair Geraldines and Countesses of
Pembroke.” While Lord Randolph Churchill was still alive,
a young man—now an eminent Liberal statesman, and then
in the thick of a passionate courtship—poured out his heart to
him as they walked home together from the House. Lord
Randolph reminded him of what Disraeli had once observed
to himself, that two of the great elements in life were passion
and power; that in youth the first prevailed, but that, as years
proceeded, the last proved incomparable. He once said in
his early youth that most of the distinguished men of his
acquaintance who had married “for love” bullied or maltreated
their wives; and he also remarked at an early period that the
man who wishes to rule mankind must not marry a too
beautiful wife, who would divide his time and his will. Long
afterwards, in the devotion of his home, Mrs. Disraeli would
rally him by saying, “You know you married me for money,
and I know that now, if you had to do it again, you would
marry me for love.” It will be recalled, too, that “Sidonia,”
though he had a heart, indulged his deeper emotions more
towards causes than individuals. “In his organisation there
was a peculiarity, perhaps a great deficiency.” And yet
Disraeli wrote: “We know not how it is, but love at first
sight is a subject of constant ridicule, but somehow we suspect
that it has more to do with the affairs of this world than the
world is willing to own.”—“Where we do not respect, we soon
cease to love; when we cease to love, virtue weeps and flies.”
I think that real love as the base of marriage is more genuinely,
as well as romantically, portrayed in <cite>Venetia</cite> that in any of
his works. In those pages it really moves us instead of moving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
before us, as it often does, even in the “love story” of
<cite>Henrietta Temple</cite>. One of his early hobbies, too, was that
men ought to marry early, as a source of strength and
simplicity both to the affections and to the race. This is
emphasised in <cite>Contarini Fleming</cite>. The passage is striking,
and illustrates his deeper ideas on the whole subject: “To
a man who is in love the thought of another woman is
uninteresting, if not repulsive. Constancy is human nature.
Instead of love being the occasion of all the misery of this
world, as is sung by fantastic bards, <em>I believe that the misery
of this world is occasioned by there not being love enough</em>....
Happiness is only to be found in a recurrence to the principles
of human nature, and these will prompt very simple manners.
For myself, I believe that permanent unions of the sexes
should be early encouraged; nor do I conceive that general
happiness can ever flourish but in societies where it is the
custom for all males to marry at eighteen. This custom, I am
informed, is not unusual in the United States of America,
and its consequence is a simplicity of manners and purity of
conduct <em>which Europeans cannot comprehend, but to which they
must ultimately have recourse</em>. Primeval barbarism and extreme
civilisation must arrive at the same results. Men under these
circumstances are actuated by their structure; in the first
instance instinctively, in the second philosophically. At
present<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> we are all in the various gradations of the intermediate
state of corruption.”</p>

<p>At all events, his own compositions were conspicuously
spotless; and it may be said of him, as it was of Addison—so
unlike otherwise—“No whiter page remains.”</p>

<p>Such, then, are some of Disraeli’s main ideas on the
outward forms and inward spirit of society. Fashionable
“society” he played with, and he used—it amused him; but
he never cherished, rather he scorned it. Power he valued;
and fame—“the opinion of mankind after death”—for him
meant power. There was once a certain rather fussy Radical
member who had long been anxious to make his acquaintance.
When <cite>Lothair</cite> appeared, he rushed up to Disraeli excitedly,
with many apologies for the intrusion, and begged him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
receive the assurance of his daughter’s intense admiration for
that work. “Thank you ever so much,” returned Disraeli,
“<em>and this is fame</em>!”</p>

<p>When the gorgeous trinket was in his grasp, and he was
at the zenith of his eminence, I have already recorded an
impressive instance. I may contrast with this another picture,
also of a fact already chronicled in the interesting recollections
of a young associate of his old age. It will bear repetition.
The scene was Hughenden in late autumn, the time, after
Lady Beaconsfield’s death. He sat in reverie before the fire,
watching the flickering embers. “Dreams, dreams, dreams,”
he murmured, as the wreaths of smoke and the sparks of flame
went upwards. He was thinking of his favourite Sheridans,
by whose own fireside, and basking in whose sunshine of wit
and beauty, so many of his happiest evenings had been spent
forty years agone. And perhaps, also, he was thinking of that
charming daughter of Lord Lyndhurst, whose pet name tallied
with his own sister’s; and possibly, too, of that little Frances
Braham, whom he had known in girlhood, and whom, after
she, too, had carved a career, he still knew and admired as
Frances, Lady Waldegrave.</p>

<p>Yet one more dissolving <span class="locked">view—</span></p>

<p>The scene shifts again to London and a Foreign Office
reception, with its gaping throng. It was the last function that
Lady Beaconsfield, frail with age and bent with rheumatism,
was able to attend. Step by step, all the way down that long
staircase, he himself planted her feet and tenderly supported
her feeble frame, till, when she reached the end, he presented
to her a youth of promise, since a member of ministries,
who will still remember it.</p>

<p>Yes, it was companionship, not “society,” that was precious
to him. And trial proves friendship.</p>

<p>“‘Since I last met you, I heard you had seen much and
suffered much.’—‘And that makes the kind thoughts of friends
more precious.’—‘You have, however, a great many things
which ought to make you happy.’—‘I do not deserve to be
happy, for I have made so many mistakes....’—‘Take a
brighter and a nobler view of your life.... Feel rather that
you have been tried and not found wanting.’”</p>

<span class="smcap">Wit, Humour, Romance</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Whatever</span> Disraeli wrote was always literature,
and never lecture. He was a born man of letters,
and Dickens once lamented that politics had so
long and often deprived fiction of a master.</p>

<p>Disraeli is renowned for his wit; but he is not so
generally famed for two qualities in which he excelled,
though with limitations—his subtle sense of humour and his
fine feeling for the picturesque and romantic.</p>

<p>Like his own “Sidonia,” Disraeli “said many things that
were strange, yet they instantly appeared to be true;” like
his own “Pinto,” he “had the art of viewing common things
in a fanciful light.” I shall notice both these characteristics.
He believed in the force of phrases as a pollen, so to
speak, of ideas wafted through the air; and he believed in
the perpetual miracles of existence. His favourite English
authors were the romantics of Queen Elizabeth and the wits
of Queen Anne and the Georges.</p>

<p>It was once said that wit is a point, but humour a straight
line. This epigram is inadequate. Wit is no <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">résumé</i> of
humour; the two qualities differ in kind. Wit is a department
of style; and style is gesture, accent, expression.
Wit is the faculty of combining the unlike, by the language
of illustration, suggestion, and surprise. It sums up characters,
things, and ideas. Like misery, “it yokes strange bedfellows,”
but with the link of words alone. It is best when intellectually
true, but its requisite is <em>fancy</em>, and its domain expression.
Humour, on the other hand, is an exercise of perceptive
sympathy; it is the faculty of discerning the incongruous,
especially of human nature, in the visible alone; it “looks on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
this picture and on that;” it is most excellent when ethically
sound, but its essence is insight, and its sphere, situation.</p>

<p>No one ever heard of a witty picture, or a humorous
epigram. We laugh at humour, whereas at wit we smile.
Wit is, as it were, Yorick with cap and bells; but humour
unmasks him with a moral. Popular proverbs are the wit of
the people; what the crowd laughs at is its humour, and its
humour varies in different countries; but the standard of wit
is the same in all civilisations. To define wit and humour
would require both qualities, but, if I were to try my hand, I
would venture to call wit, mirth turned philosopher—humour,
philosophy at play.</p>

<p>Disraeli’s wit is at root arabesque. Its filagree flourishes,
like the ornaments of the Alhambra, are supported by solid
if slender pillars. It is fanciful grace sustained by a poised
strength; but it is also tempered by the cheery, if sententious,
cynicism of the eighteenth century, in which he had steeped
himself from childhood. Its source was racial; but its form
and colour were much influenced by Pope, Swift, and Voltaire.
He was “a master of sentences.” He delighted to condense
thought, as it were, in civilised proverbs, and at the same
time to let his terse fancy<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> embellish it with subtle and airy
flourishes. His paradoxes are almost always thought in a
nutshell, and never obscure nonsense in a clever frame. Of
his directer wit, a good instance is to be found in his repartee
to the crowd at his early Marylebone election: “On what do
you stand?” “<em>My head.</em>” Or his remark on the member
who solemnly assured the House that he “took” his “stand”
on “progress.” “It occurred to me that progress was a
somewhat slippery thing to take one’s stand on.” When the
late Mr. Beresford Hope’s rather turgid remark on the “golden
image set up on the sands of Arabia” provoked Disraeli’s
famous phrase, its accompaniment was equally good. He
said that there was “a certain prudery” about the honourable
member’s eloquence which never failed to fascinate.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
great Catholic lady who received her guests “with extreme
unction” reminds one of Horace Walpole.</p>

<p>Wit, of whatever class, is, roughly speaking, twofold in
degree—lightning wit and wit lambent—the wit that strikes
sharply, and the pleasantry that shines around its object. In
the first Disraeli excelled. Like his own Monsignor, he
“sparkles with anecdote and blazes with repartee.” His
pages bristle with good things; it is hard to choose. Every
one remembers his political retorts and his literary aphorisms.
“One whom I will not say that I respect, but rather that I
regard.” Another, “Who has learned much, but has still to
learn that petulance is not sarcasm, nor insolence invective.”
The “conjuror who advances to the edge of the platform, and
for hours draws yards of red tape from his mouth.” One
quotation against Peel—“Always ready with his Virgil”—that
of the Horatian “Vectabor tunc humeris;” and “Is
England to be governed by Popkins’ plan?” “Batavian
Grace,” “Superior Person,” and the like. Then there are the
drunken recruits “full of spirit;” the hansom, the “gondola
of London;” the critics, “the men who have failed;”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
Tadpole’s, “Tory men and Whig measures;” and Rigby’s,
“little words in great capitals”—these are household words.
“Our young Queen, and our old institutions.” There are
Diplomatists, “the Hebrews of politics;” St. James’s Square,
“the Faubourg St. Germain of London;” the “bad politician”
of the ’thirties, who “like a bad shilling has worn off his edge
by his very restlessness,” and the enlightened Whig minister
“almost eructating with the plenary inspiration of the spirit of
the age;” the men of the ’seventies who “played with billiard-balls
games that were not billiards,” and the lady of the
’forties who “sacrificed even her lovers to her friends;” stolid
bores, our “Social Polyphemi;” books, “the curse of the
human race;” of Austria, “two things made her a nation, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
was German and she was a Catholic, and now she is neither;”
of the Reform Bill, “It gave to Manchester a bishop and to
Birmingham a dandy.” And, less familiar, there is “Lord
Squib’s” definition of money value, “very dear;” “Count
Mirabel’s” pleasantry, “coffee and confidence;” “Essper
George’s,” “Like all great travellers, I have seen more than I
remember, and remembered more than I have seen;” Venus,
the “goddess of watering-places,” and “Burlington” with
“his old loves and new dances.” There is the advice in <cite>The
Young Duke</cite>, too, that “good fortune with good management,
no country house and no children, is Aladdin’s lamp,” and
that in <cite>Lothair</cite> to “go into the country for the first note of
the nightingale and return to town for the first muffin bell.”
Then there is the “treatise on a subject in which everybody is
interested, in a style no one understands;” and there are the
French actresses averring at supper, “No language makes
you so thirsty as French;” the English tradesmen who
“console themselves for not getting their bills paid by inviting
their customers to dinner;” the Utilitarian, whose dogma was
“Rules are general, feelings are general, and property should
be general;” and the definition of Liberty, “Do as others
do, and never knock men down.” There is Monmouth’s
“some woman has got hold of him and made him a Whig.”
There is the great political lady “who liked handsome
people, even handsome women;” and there is the unfortunate
third-rate statesman, “who committed suicide from a
want of imagination.” Nor should I omit an unprinted <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mot</i>.
He defined a political “Deputation” as “a noun of multitude
meaning many, but not signifying much.” He was
wont also to distinguish between “lawyers” and “legislators.”
A brace of very witty similes also claim a mention
here—the comparison of the Parliament-built region of Harley
Square to “a large family of plain children with Portland
Place and Portman Square for their respectable parents;”
and that of the detached breakfast-tables at “Brentham,” to
“a cluster of Greek or Italian Republics, instead of a great
metropolitan table, like a central government, absorbing all
the genius and resources of society.” Further, in the same
category are the many metaphorical allusions and descriptions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
that ornament his speeches. The transference of the Bank
currency crisis to the Neapolitan procession and miracle
of St. Januarius, both from a common cause, “congealed circulation;”
the picture of a maladroit reinforcement of opposition
as the exploit of the Turkish Admiral, summoned by the
Sultan and blessed by the muftis, to retrieve the war, who yet
steered his imposing fleet right into the enemy’s port; and
the many illustrations from Cervantes, whose irony they share.</p>

<p>Then, again, there are those terse figurative fancies which
belong to the family of those first mentioned. The “Midland
Sea” for the Mediterranean; the “Western minster” for
Westminster Abbey; the “dark sex” for man; the “free-trader
in gossip” for the bad listener; the “confused
explanations and explained confusions,” “Stateswoman”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>
and “Anecdotage,” which, by-the-by, is a phrase of Isaac
Disraeli derived by him in conversation from Rogers<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>—all
these and their kindred remind us that he was the son of an
author portrayed by him as sauntering on his garden terrace
meditating some happy phrase.</p>

<p>Of the second—the wit of sustained sparkle rather than of
sudden flashes—there are abundant examples. There is the
passage in which “Lady Constance” in <cite>Tancred</cite> unconsciously
ironises evolution in her criticism of a pamphlet,
“The Revelations of Chaos.” There is the lady’s reasoning
on the Gulf Stream theory, and “Lothair’s” retort, “You
believe in Gulf Stream to that extent—no skating.” There
is the pious regret that a boring authoress could not be
married to the author of “The Letters of Junius” and “have
done with it;” and the pious hope that the Whigs would disfranchise
every town without a Peel statue. Then, again,
there is “Herbert” in <cite>Venetia</cite>.</p>

<p>“I doubt whether a man at fifty is the same material being
that he is at five-and-twenty.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Lord Cadurcis, “if a creditor brought an
action against you at fifty for goods sold and delivered at
five-and-twenty, one could set up the want of identity as a
plea in bar; it would be a consolation to elderly gentlemen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
And to go back to an even earlier <span class="locked">date—</span></p>

<p>“What a pity, Miss Manvers, that the fashion has gone
out of selling one’s self to the devil!... <em>What a capital plan
for younger brothers!</em> It is a kind of thing I have been trying
to do all my life, and never could succeed in. I began at
school with toasted cheese and a pitchfork.”</p>

<p>Or take the report of the debate in the House of Lords,
“imposing, particularly if we take a part in <span class="locked">it”—</span></p>

<p>“Lord Exchamberlain thought the nation going on wrong,
and he made a speech full of currency and constitution.
Baron Deprivyseal seconded him with great effect, brief but
bitter, satirical but sore. The Earl of Quarterday answered
these, full of confidence in the nation and himself. When the
debate was getting heavy, Lord Snap jumped up to give
them something light. The Lords do not encourage wit,
and so are obliged to put up with pertness. But Viscount
Memoir was very statesmanlike, and spouted a sort of universal
history. Then there was Lord Ego, who vindicated his
character, when nobody knew he had one, and explained his
motives, because his auditors could not understand his acts.”</p>

<p>Or the comparison of the defeated Tories to the Saxons
converted by <span class="locked">Charlemagne—</span></p>

<p>“... When the Emperor appeared, instead of conquering,
he converted them. How were they converted? In battalions;
the old chronicler informs us they were converted
in battalions, and baptised in platoons. It was utterly impossible
to bring these individuals from a state of reprobation
to one of grace with sufficient celerity.”</p>

<p>In his speeches again there is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">locus classicus</i> of “the
range of exhausted volcanoes”—“not a flame flickers on a
single pallid crest.” There are the wonderful political pictures
of the “Calabrian Earthquake,” the “ragged regiment that
would not march through Coventry—that’s flat;” “Melbourne
with his Reform Ministry and Ducrow still professing to ride on
three sullen jackasses at once, but sprawling in the sawdust of
the arena;” of Peel as the profligate deserting his mistress and
“sending down his valet to say, ‘I will have no whining here,’”
and a hundred others as good.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Perhaps “Gamaliel, with all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
the broad ‘phylacteries on his forehead,’ who ‘comes down to tell
us that he is not as other men are,’ in reference to the ‘Cabal’
of 1859, should also be included. This is the ‘parliamentary
wit’ which Gladstone avowed unrivalled, and these, the vivid
illustrations and metaphors, which he declared supreme in
power of ‘summing up characters and situations,’ and fraught
with the gift of ‘appealing to the ear and the fancy.’”</p>

<p>But there is also one from <cite>The Press</cite> of 1853 which is
unknown, and claims a memorial. He is referring to the
“Coalition” Ministry of 1853—one, as he calls it, of “suspended
opinions,” and “resembling the ark into which creatures
of the most opposite species walked two by two.” It
singles out a magnificent “over-educated mediocrity” among
the strait sect of the “Peelites”—those who in Lady Clanricarde’s
epigram “were always putting themselves up to
auction and buying themselves in again.” It satirises
that leader’s protest that he was still a “Conservative,” his
announced “regret at the rupture of ancient ties,” his “hope
of some future <span class="locked">reunion”—</span></p>

<p>“... Amiable regret! Honourable hope! reminding us
of those inhabitants of the South Sea Islands, who never
devour their enemies—that would be paying them too great a
compliment. They eat up only their own friends and relations
with an appetite proportioned to the love that they bear
to them. And then they hasten to deck themselves in the
feathers and trappings of those thus tenderly devoured in
memorial of their regret at the ‘rupture of ancient ties,’ and
their ‘hope of some future reunion.’ Do you feel quite safe
with your new ally? Do you not dread that the same
affectionate tooth will some day be fastened upon your own
shoulders?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
No wonder that Lord Granville—“un radical qui aime la
bonne societé”—described Disraeli as a “master” in the
literary expression of “praise and blame.”</p>

<p>Last, though not least, should be mentioned Pinto’s dictum
on <span class="locked">English—</span></p>

<p>“It is an expressive language, but not difficult to master.
Its range is limited. It consists, so far as I can observe, of
four words, “nice,” “jolly,” “charming,” and “bore;” and
some grammarians add “fond.”</p>

<p>But none knew better than Disraeli that wit unrelieved is
metallic. He had a very real perception of the ludicrous, and
it was usually of a cast bordering on irony. In boyhood,
Disraeli had been a great admirer of Montaigne, one of those
authors, as he acknowledged, who “give a spring to the
mind;” but I cannot discern any influence of Montaigne’s
twinkling stillness on Disraeli’s humour. The humour of
Molière and of Sheridan, like that of Fielding, of Hogarth,
and of Dickens, is direct and didactic, pointing to the follies
and foibles of mankind. That, on the other hand, of Sterne,
often of Thackeray, always of Heine, is indirect, inclined to
be sentimental, and insinuating with all the machinery of
playful surprise, the inconsistencies that enlist feeling or
awaken thought. Swift’s grim and creative humour, also,
that “knocks off the tallest of heads” with a knotted
bludgeon, wielded, however, by an imaginative fierceness, is
of the same order; and Swift had been early studied, was
constantly quoted, and often imitated by Disraeli. The
former is the broadsword of Cœur de Lion; the latter, the
scimitar of Saladin. It is of this latter species that Disraeli
at his best must be reckoned. It stamps the whole of
<cite>Popanilla</cite>, and much of <cite>Ixion</cite>, and <cite>The Infernal Marriage</cite>,
and it interleaves both his wit, his argument, and his reflection
throughout his novels, and, conspicuously in his triumph,
<cite>Coningsby</cite>.</p>

<p>Take “Lord Monmouth’s” indignant lesson to the hero:
“You go with your family, sir, like a gentleman. <em>You are not
to consider your opinions like a philosopher or a political adventurer</em>;”
or the motive for his bequest of his bust to “Rigby,”
“that he might perhaps wish to present it to another friend;”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
or the same amiable nobleman’s reason for esteeming besides
appreciating “Sidonia”—he was so rich that he could not be
bought. “A person or a thing that you perhaps could not
buy, became,” in his eyes, “invested with a kind of halo
amounting almost to sanctity.” “Lord Monmouth,” indeed,
and “Rigby” are Disraeli’s masterpieces in this vein; and
“Mrs. Guy Flouncey,” who, like “Becky,” “was always sure of
an ally the moment the gentlemen entered the drawing-room,”
follows at no very remote distance. Take “Waldershare’s”
account of England’s <span class="locked">ascendency:—</span></p>

<p>“I must say it was a grand idea of our Kings making
themselves sovereigns of the sea. <em>The greater portion
of this planet is water, so we at once became a first-rate
power.</em>”</p>

<p>Or the Homeric simplicity of the “Ansary” tribe, who
believe London to be surrounded by sea, and inquire if the
English dwell in ships, and are thus corrected by their
would-be interpreter “Keferinis”—</p>

<p>“The English live in ships only during six months of the
year—principally when they go to India—the rest entirely at
their country houses.”</p>

<p>Similarly, too, is the oblique sarcasm of “<cite>Tancred’s</cite>”
“Fakredeen”—</p>

<p>“... We ought never to be surprised at anything that
is done by the English, who are, after all, in a certain sense,
savages.... Everything they require is imported from other
countries.... I have been assured at Beiroot that they do
not grow even their own cotton; but that I can hardly
believe. <em>Even their religion is an exotic, and, as they are
indebted for that to Syria, it is not surprising they should
import their education from Greece.</em>”</p>

<p>So, too, the piteous plight of the two honest servants—“Freeman
and Trueman”—who complain to their master, in
sight of Sinai, that they “do miss the ‘ome-brewed ale and
the family prayers;” and the twice-raised wonder of the
“Swells” as to what could drag one of their compeers
to Palestine: “I believe Jeremiah somewhere mentions
partridges.” Nor should “St. Aldegonde’s sigh”—“of a rebellious
Titan”—at refusing to attend morning church at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Brentham be forgotten: “Sunday in London is bad, but
Sunday in the country is infernal;” or his dainty wife’s
elaborate efforts that he should never be bored; or the
handsome Duke’s<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> daily thanksgiving as he completed his
“consummate toilette” that he had a family “worthy of
him.”</p>

<p>“Rigby’s” election, too—an excellent example—well illustrates
the man to whom the country meant nothing in comparison
with the constituency, and to whom his titled patron’s
choice of him as executor was a “sublime truth.” The whole
scene is one of sustained humour. I will only cite “Rigby’s”
“grand peroration.”</p>

<p>“... He assured them that the eyes of the whole empire
were on this particular election (cries of ‘That’s true!’ on all
sides), and England expected every man to do his duty.
‘<em>And who do you expect to do yours</em>,’ inquired a gentleman
below, ‘<em>about that ’ere pension?</em>’...”</p>

<p>Then again, the episode of the Justice of the Peace in
<cite>Venetia</cite>, and this from <cite>Endymion</cite>—</p>

<p>“The chairman opened the proceedings, but was coldly
received, though he spoke sensibly and at some length. He
then introduced a gentleman who was absolutely an alderman
to move a resolution.... The august position of the speaker
atoned for his halting rhetoric; and a city which had only
just for the first time been invested with municipal privileges
was hushed before a man who might in time even become a
mayor.”</p>

<p>So, too, once more; the description of “Armine’s” experiences
in the sponging-house, where the only literature was
a Hebrew Bible. This is from <cite>Henrietta Temple</cite>. In <cite>Vivian
Grey</cite>, his first novel, occurs the same whimsical humour that
is to be found in his last, <cite>Endymion</cite>. The German statesman
is pointing a <em>gourmet</em>-metaphysician, “stuffing ‘kalte schale’
in a corner.”</p>

<p>“... The leaven of the idealists, a pupil of the celebrated
Fichte.... The first principle of this school is to reject all
expressions which incline in the slightest degree to substantiality....
Matter is his great enemy. My dear sir, observe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
how exquisitely Nature revenges herself on these capricious
and fantastic children. Methinks that the best answer to
the idealism of M. Fichte is to see his pupil devouring <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">kalte
schale</i>.”</p>

<p>In <cite>Lothair</cite> few will forget the hero’s musings after the
opera attendant’s “Thank you, my lord” had attested the
“overpowering honorarium.”</p>

<p>“‘He knows me,’ thought Lothair; but it was not so.
When the British nation is at once grateful and enthusiastic,
they always call you ‘my lord.’” And in the same novel
occurs the admirable humour of the scene at Muriel Towers,
where the new French dance which is remembered and
at last arranged by the impromptu good humour and cleverness of
“Theodora,” is muddled by “Lord Carisbrook,” who
sums up his knowledge by “Newest thing in Paris,” yet,
notwithstanding, grins afterwards, quite self-satisfied, with his
“I am glad I remembered it.”</p>

<p>There remains this light thrust at London <span class="locked">architecture—</span></p>

<p>“Shall we find refuge in a committee of taste, escape
from the mediocrity of one to the mediocrity of many?...
One suggestion might be made. No profession in England
has done its best until it has furnished its victim. The pure
administration of justice dates from the deposition of Macclesfield....
Even our boasted navy never achieved a victory
until we shot an admiral. <em>Suppose an architect were hanged!</em>”</p>

<p>And, finally, how admirable is the mock epic of the <em>chef’s</em>
dilemma at the opening of <cite>Tancred</cite>: “It is worthy of
Boileau.”</p>

<p>“... ‘What you learned from me,’ says Papa Prevost,
‘came at least from a good school. It is something to have
served under Napoleon,’ he added, with the grand air of the
imperial kitchen. ‘Had it not been for Waterloo, I should
have had the cross. <em>But the Bourbons and the Cooks of the
Empire never could understand each other.</em> They brought over
an emigrant <em>chef</em> who did not comprehend the taste of the age.
He wished to bring everything back to the time of the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">œil-de-bœuf</i>.”
<em>When Monsieur passed my soup of Austerlitz untasted,
I knew the old family was doomed.</em>.’... ‘We must
muster all our forces,’ says the great Leander. ‘There is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
want not only of genius but of men in our art. The Cooks
are like the civil engineers: since the middle class have taken
to giving dinners, the demand exceeds the supply.’ ‘There
is Andrien,’ said Papa Prevost; ‘you had some hopes of
him.’ ‘He is too young. I took him to Hellingsley, and
he lost his head on the third day. I entrusted the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soufflés</i>
to him, and but for the most desperate personal exertions,
all would have been lost. <em>It was an affair of the Bridge
of Arcola.</em>’...” How Lilliput and Brobdingnag here
combine! I prefer this epic-fantasy to the lyric-fantasy of
Thackeray’s “Mirobolant.”</p>

<p>When Disraeli was out of office for the last term, he was
walking with a leading member of the Government that had
replaced his own. The statesman asked him how he thought
the new Administration was getting on. “Pretty well,” was
his answer, “but I like the old-fashioned methods. The first
year you do nothing; the second year you talk of doing
something; the third year you do something—and succeed;
the fourth you do something—and fail; the fifth year you
spend in discussing whether it was a failure or not; the sixth,
you go to the country, <em>who pronounce that it was</em>.”</p>

<p>Most of these are to some degree fanciful <em>persiflage</em>. Not
so the following—a passage alluded to in a note already, and
compared with another one from Heine. He is describing
the Vintage Feast of Tabernacles, and the passage is the
more remarkable because Disraeli’s father instances this very
festival as one of the obsolete and fanatical absurdities that
unfit the Old Testament religion for its proper fulfilment by
the <span class="locked">New:—</span></p>

<p>“Picture to yourself the child of Israel in the dingy
suburb or the stolid quarter of some bleak Northern town,
where there is never a sun that can at any rate ripen grapes;
yet he must celebrate the vintage of purple Palestine....
He rises in the morning, goes early to some Whitechapel
market, purchases some willow boughs for which he has
previously given a commission, and which are brought
probably from one of the neighbouring rivers of Essex,
hastens home, cleans out the yard of his miserable tenement,
builds his bower, decks it even profusely with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
finest flowers and fruit he can procure, and hangs its roof
with variegated lamps. After the service of his synagogue,
he sups late with his wife and children, as if he were in the
pleasant villages of Galilee beneath its sweet and starry
sky.... Perhaps as he is offering up the peculiar thanksgiving,
... and his wife and children are joining in a pious
‘Hosanna’—that is, ‘Save us’—<em>a party of Anglo-Saxons, very
respectable men, ten-pounders, a little elevated, it may be,
though certainly not in honour of the vintage, pass the house,
and words like these are heard: ‘I say, Buggins, what’s
that row?’ ‘Oh, it’s those cursed Jews! We’ve a lot of them.
It’s one of their horrible feasts. The Lord Mayor ought to
interfere. However, things are not so bad as they used to be.
They used always to crucify little boys at their hullabaloos, but
now they only eat sausages made of stinking pork.’ ‘To be
sure,’ replies his companion, ‘we all make progress.’</em>”</p>

<p>And there are many pendants to this kind of pathetic
humour in the sad vagaries, degraded ignorance, sordid joys
and squalid sorrows of the operatives of “Wodgate” so
sympathetically presented in <cite>Sybil</cite>:—</p>

<p>“... ‘They call me Tummas, but I ayn’t got no second
name; but now I’m married I mean to take my wife’s, for
she has been baptised, and so has got two.’ ‘Yes, sir,’ said
the girl with the vacant face and the back like a grasshopper,
‘I be a reg’lar born Christian, and my mother afore me, and
that’s what few gals in the yard can say. Thomas will take
to it himself when work is slack; and he believes now in Our
Lord and Saviour Pontius Pilate, who was crucified to save
our sins, and in Moses, Goliath, and the rest of the apostles.’
‘Ah, me!’ thought Morley, ‘and could not they spare
one missionary from Tahiti for their fellow-countrymen at
Wodgate?’”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I must turn to the romantic and the picturesque in Disraeli’s
fiction. It is a large subject, but it need not necessitate a
long treatment.</p>

<p>The Brontës and Bulwer Lytton, in opposed spheres and
with opposite material, are perhaps the only modern pure
romantics in English fiction, before the romantic revival of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
the last twenty years or so had set in. In the early nineteenth
century Sir Walter Scott had headed another romantic
revival. Miss Austen, however,—the miniaturist of realism—recalled
fiction in her delicate manner to the beaten high-road
of the eighteenth. Dickens, romantic by instinct, dwelt on the
horrible and grotesque, and was more melodramatic than
strictly romantic. Thackeray, sternly combating the infinite
romance of his own nature, disclaimed a hero, and proved
sentimental rather than romantic. Trollope, who photographed
feeling, abominated romance. George Eliot set out
as a romantic, but she soon became gloriously whelmed in
the vortex of scientific psychology. Others, who lack her
imagination, have since followed in her track. We have
been treated to analytic presentations of life, where some five
persons engage in a mutual war of motive, and the very
reasons for turning a door-handle are minutely involved in
character. On the one hand, we had the English and French
sensationalists elaborately unravelling mysteries; on the
other, the boudoir psychologists as elaborately anatomising
moods. The great “naturalist” school supervened with its
claims to scientise misery. Victor Hugo’s romanticism was
doomed by the merciless lancet of these literary surgeons.
And throughout—even now, in the main, using “romance”
more with regard to situation and expression than to events—the
purely and simply heroic and adventurous has lost ground.
Mind rather than action engrossed a great part of late nineteenth-century
fiction.</p>

<p>With all faults, native and imposed, Disraeli proclaimed
in his novels, in those which were political fairy-tales, as in
those which were not, “adventures are to the adventurous;”
and this very phrase, too, occurs in his earliest satire. <cite>Contarini
Fleming</cite> was originally styled “The Psychological Romance;”
<cite>Alroy</cite> is undoubtedly a romance historical; <cite>The Young
Duke</cite>, a romance of fashion; <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, one both of
fashion and of ambition; <cite>Venetia</cite>, of biography; <cite>Henrietta
Temple</cite>, of love; and the rest, romances of the world’s actors
and action.</p>

<p>But the extraordinary is merely the mantle of romanticism
proper. Its method is everything. It is one that brings up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
before us at once the thing seen and the man seeing. It
releases individuality from stereotyped shackles, it transfers
interest from achievement to achievement’s atmosphere, and
it lends to landscape-painting the same element that it lends
to character-drawing.</p>

<p>The French separate their terms in distinguishing between
real and feigned romance. The one they call <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">romantique</i>;
the other, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">romanesque</i>. The really romantic in fiction is so
to write as to import into the interest of the extraordinary
the interest also of the author’s temperament. Both the
unusual subject and the imparted atmosphere are requisites.
<em>Rasselas</em> is an unusual subject sententiously treated. It is
parable, not romance. The <cite>Song of the Shirt</cite> is an, alas!
commonplace theme transfigured by sympathy. It is pathetic,
not romantic. Sir Walter Scott, however, is romantic <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par
excellence</i>. We are sure that his background is unusual, and
he stamps his individuality on the foreground. So, too, with
his pictures of scenery. The writer’s heart, rather than his
head, pervades the perspective. The unromantic author is a
showman, the romantic author an actor. The one fits character
to persons; the other from persons evolves character. The
romantic reveals the wonderful to us by personal feeling.
Ruskin once defined the picturesque as “parasitical sublimity;”
Carlyle, too (as romantic and picturesque himself as Ruskin),
denounces the faculty in which he excelled. But these
thinkers failed, perhaps, to grasp that the root of the most
beautiful impressions is association interwoven with memory,
fancy, affection, even superstition, and the symbols of very
names. Strip Venice of her climate, rob man of his memory,
and where is the Venice that Ruskin adored? Absolute
beauty does exist, but rarely; and we atone for imperfections
by supplementing it with the endearments of outward accident.
It is Nature’s own method; she garlands the rift of ruins
with her greenery. The dead letter sleeps in literature as in
life, of which literature ought to be the most sensitive mirror.
Warmth is as indispensable as light; and if fiction is to remain
an art and not sink into a false science, the dry bones of hard
facts must be made to live. By these means, too, the personal
influence of great writers is most practically preserved. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
wonderful in Nature can never be unnatural. It is only the
affectation of it that is so—and that is usually accompanied
by Mrs. Malaprop’s “nice derangement of epitaphs.”</p>

<p>Now, so far as Disraeli’s characters merely typify—and
they do often—causes or movements, they are not romantic,
however picturesque their garb. But so far as they do not,
they are essentially romantic, and, where politicians in council
are not concerned, this is constantly the case.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more romantic, both in matter and manner,
than the first introduction of “Sidonia.” The “Princess
Lucretia Colonna” in <cite>Coningsby</cite>, is romance incarnate. “Morley,”
again, in <cite>Sybil</cite> is a most romantic figure. The whole
episode of the “Baronis,” in <cite>Tancred</cite>, is genuinely and
strikingly romantic. So is the figure of “Theodora” in
<cite>Lothair</cite>; and all these occur in political novels. But in the
non-political they abound. The early squibs are, perhaps,
the only romantic skits in our language. <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, too,
is full of romance, and comprises the romantic drolleries of
“Essper George,” a modern Sancho. The whole of <cite>Venetia</cite>
and all the action of <em>Contarini</em> are romantic; so is his only
and halting drama, <cite>Alarcos</cite>. Though at times, and from
causes which I shall consider, there is in these early novels
something of old Drury, and too much occasionally of the
“Ha!-and-Pah!” attitude, these are only blemishes in the
costume; the figures remain romantic.</p>

<p>But it is, perhaps, in the short but charming descriptions
of character and of scenery that Disraeli best showed his
powers for the romantic and the picturesque. Take the
character of “Fakredeen;” take even the character of Sir
Robert Peel in the <cite>Life of Lord George Bentinck</cite>. Take
a hundred touches from his <cite>Home Letters</cite>, and those to
his sister and family. He there says that “description is a
bore,” but he contrived in a few strokes to picture without
describing. The sunset at Athens, “like the neck of a dove.”
His vignettes of the Parthenon, of the Lagoons, of Jerusalem,
of Syria, both here and in <em>Contarini</em>, <cite>Tancred</cite>, and <cite>Lothair</cite>,
are etched by a master-hand.</p>

<p>Disraeli casts over his scenes the reflected glow of associative
feeling. Peruse the beautiful rendering of “Marney<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Abbey” in <cite>Sybil</cite> (too long to quote). It is essentially a
placid scene romantically described, with an individual feeling
of soft regret and tender awe communicated to the dreamy
landscape. It proves his delight in what he called “the
sweet order of country life;” his feeling for the “order of the
peasantry ... succeeded by a race of serfs who are called
labourers and burn ricks.”</p>

<p>If we would note the contrast in unromantic writers of
genius, we have only to re-read Jane Austen’s description
of Northanger Abbey, where, be it marked, in purposely
deriding the false romance of a girl’s sickly fancy, she must
have desired to depict the demesne with every impressive
attribute.</p>

<p>And take this from <cite>Tancred</cite>: “Sometimes the land is
cleared, and he finds himself by the homestead of a forest
farm.... Still advancing the deer become rarer, and the
road is formed by an avenue of chestnuts.... Persons are
moving to and fro on the side-path of the road. Horsemen
and carts seem returning from market; women with empty
baskets, and then the rare vision of a stage-coach. The
postillion spurs his horses, cracks his whip, and dashes at full
gallop into the town of Montacute, the capital of the forest....
Nor does this green domain terminate till it touches
the vast and purple moors that divide the kingdoms of Great
Britain.”</p>

<p>The effects of light play a leading part in Disraeli’s
landscapes.</p>

<p>“... Nor is there, indeed, a sight” (of Mont Blanc in
<em>Contarini</em>) “more lovely than to watch at decline of day the
last embrace of the sun lingering on the rosy glaciers. Soon,
too soon, the great luminary dies; the warm peaks subside
into purple, and then die into a ghostly white: but soon, and
not too soon, the moon springs up from behind a mountain,
flings over the lake a stream of light, and the sharp glaciers
glitter like silver.”</p>

<p>This, too, of night in <span class="locked">Venice—</span></p>

<p>“... The music and the moon reign supreme.... Around
on every side are palaces and temples rising from the waves
which they shadow with their solemn form, their costly fronts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
rich with the spoils of kingdoms and softened with the magic
of the midnight beam. The whole city, too, is poured forth
for festival. The people lounge on the quays and cluster
on the bridges; the light barks skim along in crowds, just
touching the surface of the water, while their bright prows
of polished iron gleam in the moonshine and glitter in the
rippling wave. Not a sound that is not graceful—the tinkle
of guitars, the sighs of serenaders, and the responsive chorus
of gondoliers. Now and then a laugh, light, joyous, and yet
musical, bursts forth from some illuminated coffee-house,
before which a buffo disports....”</p>

<p>Here, again, is an English summer morning from <cite>Sybil</cite>—</p>

<p>“A bloom was spread over the morning sky; a soft
golden light bathed with its fresh sheen the bosom of the
valley, except where a delicate haze rather than a mist still
partially lingered over the river, which yet occasionally gleamed
and sparkled in the sunshine. A sort of shadowy lustre
suffused the landscape, which, though distinct, was mitigated
in all its features—the distant woods, the clumps of tall trees
that rose about the old grey bridge, the cottage chimneys that
sent their smoke into the blue, still air, amid their clustering
orchards and gardens, flowers and herbs.”</p>

<p>There are many more such studies of light in home
landscape, and not least in <cite>Lothair</cite>. And these are all renderings
of scenery, and not scene-painting. In those abroad
I might have included, too, the German Twilight from <cite>Vivian
Grey</cite>, and the Grecian Sunset from <em>Contarini</em>, each dashed
off with speed, yet each breathing a delicate and pensive
peace.</p>

<p>Another feature of his pencil is its fondness for and
studied conversance with the forms, and even the sounds, of
trees. Their “various voices” are introduced with effect into
the storm in <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>. As years went on, this love of
trees grew stronger. It is expressly mentioned as the hobby
of his old age by Lady John Manners. There is not one
of his novels where the varieties of wood and forest are not
handled with distinctness and affectionate observation. “Contarini’s”
pet tree is oak. In <cite>Endymion</cite> is a park entirely of
ilex. A glade at “Hurstley” is “bounded on each side with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
masses of yew, their dark green forms now studded with
crimson berries.” “Nigel Penruddock,” the Tractarian, lolls
“on the turf amid the old beeches and the juniper;” and in
the woods of a castle in <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, “There was the elm
with its rich branches bending down like clustering grapes;
there was the wide-spreading oak with its roots fantastically
gnarled; there was the ash with its smooth bark, and the
silver beech, and the gracile birch, and the dark fir affording
with its rough foliage a contrast to the trunks of its more
beautiful companions, or shooting far above their branches
with a spirit of freedom worthy of a rough child of the mountains.”
“Elegant” and “gracile” in this boyish sketch are
Johnsonese, it is true; but its romantic faculty is evident.
He delighted, too, in Elizabethan gardens and Italian parterres;
and he has drawn, both in outward and inward outline,
suggestive and romantic presentments of Oxford, Cambridge,
and Eton.</p>

<p>And he could paint the marvellous to perfection. In
<cite>Alroy</cite>, the magic ravine over which the hero must cross to
win his talisman, rises before the view with the detail of
reality: so does the ideal island of <cite>Popanilla</cite>. So—and they
really belong to the marvellous—do the great country seats
of “Montacute,” “Hellingsley,” “Beaumanoir,” “Alhambra,”
“Château Désir,” “Hainault,” “Princewood,” and “Muriel
Towers.” There are pictures, besides, of Seville, Cairo, and
the Frankfort Fair. I could have subjoined the flaming
castle in <cite>Sybil</cite>, the Derby in <cite>Endymion</cite>, the bull-fight in
<em>Contarini</em>, the desert in <cite>Alroy</cite>, the mountain storm in <cite>Vivian
Grey</cite>. But I prefer his tranquil pictures, and perhaps one of
the best is the “Cherbury” in <cite>Venetia</cite>.</p>

<p>Another prominent characteristic of his romance was its
fondness for London and the suburbs, the beauty of which,
he always held, was only half appreciated. “Airy” Brompton
and “merry” Kensington, with its young Queen “in a palace
in a garden,” touched his fancy; and the Georgian pleasaunces
of Roehampton, the antiquer abodes of Sheen dedicated to
Swift, Temple, and Stella, and the deer-haunted woodland
of Richmond Park still breathing of Anne, and Ormonde,
Pope, and Thomson, and Walpole; even, too, the Regency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
villas of Wimbledon. A few romantic strokes in <cite>Henrietta
Temple</cite> thus etch the Park of <span class="locked">London:—</span></p>

<p>“At the end of a long sunny morning, ... where can
we see such beautiful women and gallant cavaliers, such fine
horses and such brilliant equipages? The scene, too, is
worthy of such agreeable accessories; the groves, the gleaming
waters, and the triumphal arches. In the distance the
misty heights of Surrey and the bowery glades of Kensington.”
And readers of <cite>Lothair</cite> will remember with what
romance he clothes an early June morning in Bond Street,
and how, out of the prismatic hues of the fishmonger’s shop,
he weaves a garland of gay fancies; nor will he forget St.
James’s Street—that “celebrated eminence” in <cite>Endymion</cite>.
But it was more serious London that he admired most. The
foreign crannies of Soho and the dingy length of Marylebone
have both been explored by him. The Strand and the City
purlieus, however, were his favourites. The quaint sites, the
busy romances of the now grimy riverside, the historic names,
the contrast of outside flurry with inside repose, the dwelling-houses
of a past age rich with its art but now reserved
for musty parchments or massive ledgers, fascinated him.
“It is at Charing Cross,” he avers, that “London becomes
more interesting.” This is how he limns one of finance’s
<span class="locked">headquarters:—</span></p>

<p>“In a long, dark, narrow, crooked street, which is still called
a lane, and which runs from the south side of the street of
the Lombards towards the river, there is one of these old
houses of a century past.... A pair of massy iron gates of
elaborate workmanship separates the street from its spacious
and airy courtyard, which is formed on either side by a wing
of the mansion, itself a building of deep red brick, with a
pediment and pilasters and copings of stone; in the middle
of the plot there is a small garden plot inclosing a fountain,
and a very fine plane tree. The stillness, doubly effective after
the tumult just quitted, the lulling voice of the water, the
soothing aspect of the quivering foliage, the noble building
and the cool and spacious quadrangle—the aspect even of
those who enter, and frequently enter, the precincts, and who
are generally young men gliding in and out earnest and full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
of thought—all contribute to give to this locality something
of the classic repose of a college, instead of a place agitated
with the most urgent interests of the current hour.”</p>

<p>London’s motley vastness, too, and magnetism of attraction
were constantly his themes. “... It is a wonderful
place, ... this London; a nation, not a city; with a population
greater than some kingdoms, and districts as different
as if they were under different governments, and spoke
different languages.” And yet (of “Lothair”), “I have been
living here six months, and my life has been passed in a
park, two or three squares, and half a dozen streets!”</p>

<p>In <cite>Vivian Grey</cite> Disraeli whimsically observed that literature
was declining in the ’twenties through a wealth grown
so luxurious as to rank it with “ottomans, bonbons, and pier-glasses.”
“Consols at a hundred were the origin of all book
societies. There is nothing like a fall in consols to bring the
blood of our good people of England into good order.”</p>

<p>Consols have now fallen, and maybe literature is reviving.
Certain I am that, when its revival becomes pronounced, it
will be through the invigoration of romance. The strange
need not be sought in the remote. Wordsworth found it
in “laughing daffodils,” as truly as Byron in the Corsair.
Unromantic matter, romantically treated, is more refreshing
than romantic matter unquickened by personal feeling—by</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<i>Quod latet arcanâ non enarrabile fibrâ</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I have mentioned Disraeli’s early tendency towards
“Ha!” and “Pah!” For this there were several reasons
besides his own temper and that of the time.</p>

<p>When we speak of an “artificial” style we mean one
unnatural to the author. Disraeli’s style was perfectly
natural to him, and it altered little. To impose another man’s
voice on our own is real artifice. How natively pathetic he
could be, is shown by the scene in <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, where the
broken Cleveland sits and sobs amid the laughing children
on his lonely bench in Kensington Gardens; and how
simply pleasing, by the encounter after long years between
“Coningsby” and “Lady Theresa.” He constantly alternates
between the homely and the outlandish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
In the few years preceding his grand tour, and, still more,
the earlier <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>, he was at a phase in his development
when he was only just beginning to realise the true bent of
his powers, of which he had from the first been conscious,
but which had hitherto more or less perplexed and bewildered
him. In <cite>Alroy</cite> and <em>Contarini</em> his tone is one of savage force
as yet unchastened and unmellowed. The wild Arab is in
them. All the over-mastering dreams of his youth claimed
materialisation; his language went before his feelings, and
strove to outrun them by vehement strokes of attitude. He
thirsted for action, and yet drooped, restless and mortified.
His circumstances were at war with his consuming ambitions.
It was the discord of a peculiar fate and an unique
organisation; the ferment of a ripe spirit cooped by unripe
experience, of an as yet untempered vigour. The genius, as
in the old legend, shrank and dwindled in the bottle, but
soared with gigantic stature when the stopper was released.
One must not take the personal touches in <cite>Vivian</cite>, <cite>Alroy</cite>, and
<em>Contarini</em> too literally. They are a blend of several factors
and of various characters; and he himself in his age regretted
that the last had been the task of immaturity. But from
the main emphasis and the prevailing moods of the three
together, thus much one may gather.</p>

<p>“Why, what is life” (this from <cite>Alroy</cite>), “for meditation
mingles ever with my passion?... Throw accidents to
the dogs, and tear off the painted mask of false society!
Here am I, a hero; with a mind that can devise all things,
and a heart of superhuman daring, with youth, with vigour,
with a glorious lineage ... and I am—nothing.” He was
morbidly overdone, and he brooded and overdid his own
morbidity. He had lived in “a private world and a public
world,” and the two were still at variance. “I was,” he says
extravagantly of a still earlier date, on the lips of “Contarini,”
“in these days but a wild beast who thought himself a civilised
human being;” and yet “I felt the conviction that literary
creation was necessary to my existence.”—“What vanity in
all the empty bustle of common life! It brings to me no
gratification; on the contrary, degrading annoyance. It
develops all the lowering attributes of my nature.” He
was impatient, and yet he felt that “patience is a necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
ingredient of genius.” “Nothing is more fatal than to be
seduced into composition by the first flutter of the imagination.”
He had aspired to be a poet, and a poet in a new
style befitting modern life. The failure of the <cite>Revolutionary
Epick</cite> disgusted him; yet how could he have expected it to
succeed? even if it had been sold at a farthing, as in the
case of Mr. Horne’s experiment, it would never have attracted
the public, for it was a long essay in stilted verse.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> He still
aspired to influence and rule his fellow-men, but no path was
clear. These moods were not to last. “Think of me as of
some exotic bird which for a moment lost its way in thy
cold heaven, but has now regained its course and wings its
flight to a more brilliant earth, and a brighter sky.”</p>

<p>Moreover, he had for some years fostered the idea that
verse was obsolete for poetry, and that rhyme was a solecism.
Poetry should be the revelation of nature, and yet it had
sought a modern vent in unnatural language.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> He attempted,
therefore, to frame a language for poetical expression on a
plan of his own, at once rhythmical and theatrical. And for
all his confidence he was not wholly at ease. “I observed
that I was the slave of custom, and never viewed any
particular incident in relation to men in general.... I
deeply felt that there was a total want of nature in everything
connected with me.”—“When I look back on myself
at this period, I have difficulty in conceiving a more unamiable
character.” And yet instinct revolted against artificiality.
In defiance he would air his most extreme passions.
To veil them was cant. “Never apologise for showing
feeling.... Remember that when you do so, you apologise
for truth.”</p>

<p>But if something of all this is applicable to 1829, still
more is applicable to three years earlier, when <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
miracle, whatever its defects, for one barely out of his
nonage—was published;<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> and much of the phase was only
a remnant of its aggravated form in 1826. He had been
seriously and mysteriously ill. He had small acquaintance
with the great world, and continual conversance with his
visions of it. He was in doubt, even in despair. His family
was astonished, even annoyed. In <em>Contarini</em>, where his first
novel figures as “Manstein,” he has himself told us what he
regretted in <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>. It was “written in a storm and
without any reflection;” its few images were all “probably
copied from books.”—“I thought of ‘Manstein’ as of a picture
painted by a madman in the dark.”—“I determined to re-educate
myself.” Years afterwards, when these fleeting
phases had long passed, and had been succeeded by the
higher and healthier moods following on the discovery and
pursuit of his true destiny, he apologised for <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>
as a boyish freak, affected because not written from observation
of the world, and he added that every one has a right
to be conceited until he is successful. He showed his
opinion of it by publishing <em>Contarini</em> anonymously. In his
old age, he excused its “inevitable reappearance” by once
remarking that first efforts dealing with a big but unknown
world must be exaggerated in style, and that “false taste
accompanies exaggeration.” Had he been grandiose without
afterwards proving himself great, the blame would have been
deserved.</p>

<p>These are not the blemishes of his great political novels;
but there is in them also, with all their deep thought and
striking insight, their absolute originality and stimulating
suggestiveness, an air at times of the perfumer’s shop rather
than of the fresh air. Even “Sybil” cries out, “Oh! the
saints, ’tis a merry morn!” “Coningsby” meets his lady-love
at a ball, which “is a dispensation of almost supernatural
ecstasy;” and in <cite>Lothair</cite> itself we revert to “barbs”
and “jennets.” I think that these later defects were partly
due to the reaction against the constraint, repression, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
formality compelled by his political career. They were a
reaction in form, but in no case were they artificial in
substance. They meant something, and they pressed it
home. Disraeli was always a fantastic, and the fantastic
holds high rank in literature. It distinguishes Disraeli’s
pet, Cervantes. But fantasy is different far from frippery.
Fantasy is the flicker of firelight, not the flare of gas.</p>

<p>Again, it is always hard for originality to win a first
hearing from the public. Browning once remarked in a letter
that to fasten the attention of the British public some stroke
of style is required. This is true. Browning is himself an
example; Carlyle, another; for his early essays completely
lack that compound of Jean Paul’s German, and old Mrs.
Carlyle’s Scotch, out of which Carlylese was evolved. Ruskin
is another instance. Disraeli in his correspondence is far more
free and flowing than in his books. Of those books there is
least trace of apparent affectation in <cite>Coningsby</cite>, which is the
best political novel in any language. Reviewed as a whole,
his novels are creative, and a marvellous medium for thought.
Some bedizenment there is doubtless, and there are many
gauds of fancy; and parts of the characterisation may be
said to be written in italics. It is true also that some of the
persons are waxworks, but none of the characters are, and his
movement of ideas, as well as his ideas of movement, display
a flexibility rarely joined to such piercing penetration. Next
to his three great political novels and in some respects above
them, I would rank <cite>Venetia</cite>, which has never met with such
widespread appreciation. <cite>Alroy</cite> and <em>Contarini</em> are psychological
romances, exceptional of their kind. His method of
composition was the same throughout his life. He pondered
in the night what he penned in the morning. And of his
early preparation he has left a <span class="locked">memorial—</span></p>

<p>“... I prepared myself for composition in a very different
mood from that in which I had poured forth my fervid
crudities in the Garden-house. Calm and collected, I constructed
characters on philosophical principles, and mused
over a chain of action which should develop the system of
our existence. All was art. I studied contrasts and grouping,
and metaphysical analysis was substituted for anatomical
delineation. I was not satisfied that the conduct of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
creatures should be influenced merely by the general principles
of their being; I resolved that they should be the very
impersonations of the moods and passions of our mind. <em>One
was ill-regulated will;<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> another offered the formation of a moral
being</em>;<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> materialism sparkled in the wild gaiety and reckless
caprice of one voluptuous girl, while spirit was vindicated in
the deep devotion of a constant and enthusiastic heroine.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>
Even the lighter temperaments were not forgotten. Frivolity
smiled and shrugged her shoulders before us, and there was
even a deep personification of cynic humour.”</p>

<p>He believed in the influence of the creative arts on
creative authorship. He has pointed out how the Tuscan
school of painting trains to the grandeur of simplicity, the
Venetian to the gorgeousness of fancy. And of music he
has written: “The greatest advantage that a writer can
derive from it is that it teaches most exquisitely the art
of development. It is in remarking the varying recurrence
of a great composer to the same theme, that a poet may
learn how to dwell upon the phases of a passion,—how to
exhibit a mood of mind under all its alterations, and
gradually to pour forth the full tide of feeling.” But he
thought that such influences were a prelude to creation, not
to execution. “It is well to meditate upon a subject under
the influence of music, but to execute we should be alone,
and supported only by our essential and internal strength.”</p>

<p>As is familiar, he was fastidious even when he was florid.
It is well known that he relieved his last illness by correcting
the proofs of his last speeches for Hansard—“the Dunciad
of Politics.” “I will not,” he said, “descend to history
speaking bad grammar.”</p>

<p>About national literature he held views which sprang
from his theories of race. He considered that modern
Europe depended overmuch on ideas derived from Rome,
Greece, and Palestine. “At the revival of letters we beheld
the portentous spectacle of national poets communicating
their inventions in an exotic form.... They sought variety
in increased artifice of diction, and substituted the barbaric
clash of rhyme for the melody of the lyre....” Spain, he
thought, offered the best field for a national novel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
“The outdoor life of the natives induces a variety of the
most picturesque manners, while their semi-civilisation makes
each district retain with barbarous jealousy its peculiar
customs.”</p>

<p>For the critics he had a smile at the first as at the last.
They “admired what had been written in haste and without
premeditation, and generally disapproved of what had cost
me much forethought and been executed with great care....
My perpetual efforts at being imaginative were highly reprobated....
I puzzled them, and no one offered a prediction
as to my future career.... I thought no more of criticism.
The breath of man has never influenced me much, for I
depend more upon myself than upon others....”</p>

<p>At “Reisenburg” in <cite>Vivian Grey</cite> were two great journals
edited on opposite principles. In the one, every review was
written by a personal enemy; in the other by a personal
friend. And there was a third by that “literary comet,”
“Von Chronicle,” the historical novelist, who believed that in
romance costume was superior to character. His novel of
“Rienzi” terminated with the scene of the Coronation,
because “after that, what is there in the career of Rienzi
which would afford matter...? All that afterwards occurs
is a mere contest of passions and a development of character;
but where is a procession, or a triumph, or a marriage...?
Not a single name is given in the work for which he has not
contemporary authority; but what he is particularly proud
of are his oaths. Nothing has cost him more trouble than
the management of the swearing; and the Romans, you
know, are a most profane nation.... The ‘’sblood’ of the
sixteenth century must not be confounded with the ‘zounds’
of the seventeenth.... The most amusing thing is to contrast
this mode of writing works of fiction with the prevalent and
fashionable mode of writing works of history.... Here we
write novels like history and history like novels. All our
facts are fancy, and all our imagination reality.”</p>

<p>Excellent fooling, this! Through the long range of his
writings Disraeli did more than any novelist of the nineteenth
century to impress on the ordinary mind not only the
pleasures but the powers of the Imagination.</p>

<span class="subhead">CAREER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> secrets of success, Disraeli has told us more than
once, are knowledge of your capacities, constancy of
purpose, and mastery of your subject. It is seldom
that in one brain these qualities of grip, mental and
moral, are fully combined; and, rarer still, when they do
reside together, is the addition of the third requisite named
by him—patience. It, with the tact it bears, is as necessary
for the servant as the master.</p>

<p>“The magic of the character,” he says of the courier in
<em>Contarini</em>, “was his patience. This made him quicker and
readier and more successful than all other men. He prepared
everything, and anticipated wants of which we could not think.”</p>

<p>The preparation for career—apart from its entitling endowments—should
be education; but education, he held, even in
its prescientific days, often started with a vital mistake. It
proceeded on words, grammars, and systems. It should
proceed on a knowledge of predisposition; others should
know a man before he is called upon to know himself.
“What we want is to discover the character of a man at his
birth, and <cite>found his education upon his nature</cite>.... All is an
affair of organisation.... Among men there are some points
of similarity and sympathy. There are few alike; there are
some totally unlike the mass.... Until we know more of
ourselves, of what use are our systems?... We speculate
upon the character of man; we divide and we subdivide.
We have our generals, our sages, our statesmen. There is
not a modification of mind that is not mapped out in our
great atlas of intelligence. We cannot be wrong, because we
have mapped out the past; and we are famous for discovering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
the future when it has taken place. Napoleon is First Consul,
and would found a dynasty.... But what use is the discovery,
when the Consul is already tearing off his republican
robe and snatching the imperial diadem? And suppose,
which has happened, and may and will happen again—suppose
a being of a different organisation from Napoleon or Cromwell
placed in the same situation—a being gifted with a combination
of intelligence hitherto unknown—where, then, is our
moral philosophy? How are we to speculate upon results
which are to be produced by unknown causes?... The
whole system of moral philosophy is a delusion, fit only for
the play of sophists in an age of physiological ignorance.”
So, too, he had reason to think of some physicians “who
decide by precedents which have no resemblance, and never
busy themselves about the idiosyncrasies of their patients.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>
“Until,” he wrote again, “men are educated with reference
to their nature, there will be no end of domestic fracas.” He
remembered his grandfather’s misconstruction of his father’s
temperament, and his uncle’s of his own. Even illness he
considered “as much a part of necessary education as travel
or study.” And his constant idea, that national literature
ought to be native and not imported, allied itself to his
educational ideas also. “The duty of education is to give
ideas. When our limited intelligence was confined to the
literature of two dead languages, it was necessary to acquire
them.... But now each nation has its literature....
Let education, then, be confined to the national literature, and
we should soon perceive the beneficial effects upon the mind
of the student. Study would then be a profitable delight. I
pity the poor Gothic victim of the grammar and the lexicon.
The Greeks, who were masters of composition, were ignorant
of all languages but their own. They concentrated the genius
of the study of expression upon one tongue. <em>To this they owe
that blended simplicity and strength of style, which the imitative
Romans, with all their splendour, never attained.... The
ancients invented their Governments according to their wants;
the moderns have adopted foreign policies, and then modelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
their conduct upon this borrowed regulation.</em> This circumstance
has occasioned our manners and customs to be so confused,
absurd, and unphilosophical. What business had we, for
instance, to adopt the Roman law—a law foreign to our
manners, and consequently disadvantageous? He who profoundly
meditates upon the situation of modern Europe will
also discover how productive of misery has been the senseless
adoption of Oriental customs by Northern peoples. Whence
came that divine right of kings which has deluged so many
countries with blood?—that pastoral and Syrian law of tithes,
which may yet shake the foundations of so many ancient
institutions?” The spirit of this passage was ever present to
his mind. He went even further. He has asserted that the
mere fact of copying or assuming ideas deprives them of their
native virtue, and that all that is second-hand loses the vigour
and flavour of its originals in imitating them.</p>

<p>Preparation must be succeeded, and, indeed, attended, by
meditation. I shall return to this idea shortly, and consider
it in his own instance. But there comes a juncture when
action must rise from the chrysalis of thought which encloses it.</p>

<p>“... You must renounce meditation. Action is now your
part. Meditation is culture. It is well to think until a man
has discovered his genius and developed his faculties, but
then let him put his intelligence in motion. Act, act, act without
ceasing, and you will no longer talk of the vanity of life.”</p>

<p>The perpetual thought of death he considered harmful.
To live in present duty and energy was truer piety than to
brood on the coming hour when no man can work; and the
very sense of existence is a great happiness, and leads to hope.
“... If, in striking the balance of sensation, misery were
found to predominate, no human being would endure the curse
of existence....”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> He would surely have echoed that fine
saying of Gladstone—“Indifference to the world is not love
of God.” He was infinitely sanguine in outlook, although
extremely cautious in expedients. I may recall that when
<cite>Coningsby</cite> has missed his fortune, <cite>Sidonia</cite> consoles him by a
series of more disagreeable contingencies.</p>

<p>Such, then, were for him the equipments of career. Of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
arts in attaining what it designs to exercise for the good of
others, much will have been gleaned from many citations as
to tact and temper. There is one other maxim of worldly
wisdom which is worth recording: “If you wish a man to be
your friend, allow him to confute you.” His idea of power
was that it was “a divine trust,” but it was also a cumulative
fund. “The very exercise of power only teaches me that it
may be wielded for a greater purpose.” Mrs. Disraeli said,
when her husband had, in his own words, “climbed to the top
of the greasy pole at last,” “You don’t know my Dizzy, what
great plans he has long matured for the good and greatness
of England. But they have made him wait and drudge so
long—and now time is against him.”</p>

<p>It is not here my province to track the details of his own
career. This book deals with his ideas. But with the interesting
psychology of his early temperament I mean to deal, for
it concerns his ideas.</p>

<p>I might, had his career been within my scope, have cleared
some doubts, and explained many misunderstandings. I could
have shown, as I have shown elsewhere, the real truth about
the Peel letter, and the events of 1851–52. I should have
pointed out the dividing lines in his campaign and the
halting-places in his march, the Eastern tour, his marriage,
his estrangement from Peel, the Crimean War, his steady
progress in social improvements, his Reform Bills of 1859
and 1867, the strong effect on his outlook of events of magnitude,
and the last act of the drama—his imperialism. I
might also have explained the moot points connected with
the years 1833, 1835, 1837, 1846, 1851, and 1860.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> I might,
perhaps, have been able to shed light on the delayed Malmesbury
despatches in 1859. Nor should I have shirked his
mistakes, notably the motion of censure on Lord Palmerston.
And I would have dwelt on the striking influences which his
sister and his wife exercised over him.</p>

<p>But one brief topic I shall skim before I finally trace
something of his own peculiar development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Much has been talked of his alien “aloofness.” As for
alien, Mazarin was in this sense an “alien,” not to speak of
the less worthy examples, Alberoni and Ripperda. In the
eighteenth century a Scotch premier was in England an
“alien.” Augustus was partly, Napoleon wholly, an “alien.”
And what but “aliens” were Manin, Gambetta, Lasker,
Midhat, and Emin? Nobody understood his countrymen
more shrewdly at once and sympathetically than Disraeli.
His was no sham patriotism, and he loved John Bull fondly,
even when he poked fun at him. Nor had any pondered
more deeply the lessons which history imparts. There are,
however, two grains of truth in this reproach. He did regard
the world and its history as a fleeting show. He believed in
recurring cycles. What is now old was once new; what is
new will one day be old. So long as individuals worked
their best, what did it matter? One civilisation succeeds
another, and the last state of a mighty nation is often worse
than the first. “The whirligig of Time brings about his
revenges.” In this sense—the historical and philosophical
sense—he might be called indifferentist. And again, he
understood England, but it took long for his countrymen
to understand <em>him</em>. When they came to do so, he met with
that generosity which immense bravery and perseverance
always eventually receive; but, meanwhile, he had struggled
against a jealous malice which is, perhaps, peculiar to politics.
He had “educated” his followers, but suspicion and misunderstanding
hampered his every step. During two spans of some
six years each (without counting his early period) he had to
play the losing game with an unruffled brow, an encouraging
smile, and an unwearied resource, which included the transformation
of a party and foundation of a political magazine. He
had to hearten the despairing, the recalcitrant, the slothful,
and the sullen. He had to deplore the stupidity of missed
opportunities;<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> he had to humour the engrossers of office; and,
even, in the intervals of power, to bend his neck to the grindstone
of finance. “I am not,” he once sarcastically rejoined,
alluding to Sir Charles Wood opposite, “a born Chancellor
of the Exchequer.” His hour struck. At sixty-four he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
began to govern England on lines planned and with projects
pondered full thirty years earlier; and even then he had
to confront anonymous endeavours to sap his leadership
from quarters which should have disarmed suspicion. His
own mind was impartial in the extreme. The same “aloofness”
which he is alleged to have displayed to British affairs,
he certainly displayed in his books with regard to Eastern
emirs, who talk with the aspirations of the West. “Alroy”
himself is very European, and never more so than when he
disdains the isolating fanaticism of “Jabaster.”</p>

<p>Much, too, has been prattled about his “audacity,” and I
notice that the hackneyed quotation about “L’audace” is
usually in these diatribes ascribed to Danton, and not to its
author, Beaumarchais. Many of these “audacities” are now
recognised as wisdom; but it has been after-wisdom that has
recognised it; though Disraeli was usually Prometheus.</p>

<p>“There are times,” he said in one of his early novels,
“when I am influenced by a species of what I may term happy
audacity, for it is a mixture of recklessness and self-confidence,
which has a very felicitous effect upon the animal spirits. At
these moments I never calculate consequences, yet everything
seems to go right. I feel in good fortune; the ludicrous side
of everything occurs to me; I think of nothing but grotesque
images. I astonish people by bursting into laughter apparently
without a cause....”</p>

<p>Disraeli was naturally sensitive, but he studied self-repression.
No one was more cut to the quick by contumely or
impertinence; no one was more determined to hide the wound.
“If,” once observed Jowett, “Dizzy were on the brink of the
bottomless pit, and each moment about to fall into it, his look
would never betray the fact; such is his pluck and power of
countenance.” As he bore himself towards provocation, he
bore himself towards pain. The last great speech he ever
made was delivered with youthful jauntiness, yet he was
forced to take a drug in order to deliver it. “One must
meet death boldly,” he exclaimed to an intimate friend,
after he had read the denial of the doctors’ assurance in
their faces.</p>

<p>Disraeli’s intellectual shortcomings are those, it seems to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
me, belonging to an intense, as opposed to a diffused imagination.
His mind shed both heat and light, but both the
light and the heat were over-concentrated. The same applies,
perhaps, to his will, and to his character also. Everything in
him was focussed. His ideas possessed him, and he chafed,
like a sculptor at work, to embody them. Outside the forms
of those ideas he could not penetrate. In relation to them,
he judged all junctures and all endeavours. It is this averseness
to the abstract that pervades his every outlook. He
could not conceive of ideas as unmaterialised or disembodied.
They had been the companions of his boyish solitude.</p>

<p>“... The clustering of their beauty seemed an evidence
of poetic power: the management of these bright guests was
an art of which I was ignorant. I received them all, and found
myself often writing only that they might be accommodated.”</p>

<p>As a child, his ruling mood was that of reverie. He had
steeped himself in his father’s library, and his extraordinary
imagination played upon the poets, the philosophers, and,
above all, the historians. Dim dreams from the vast procession
of the centuries took shape and became flesh. He
beheld the great men and movements marching before him.
Incarnate presences peopled his loneliness, and called to him
with their <span class="locked">voices—</span></p>

<p>“The votary of a false idea, I linger in this shadowy life
and feed on silent images which no eye but mine can gaze
upon, till at length they are invested with the terrible circumstances
of life, and breathe, and act, and form a stirring world
of fate, beauty, time, death, and glory. And then, from out
this dazzling wilderness of deeds, I wander forth and wake
... horrible! horrible!” “Often in reverie had I been an
Alberoni, a Ripperda, a Richelieu....” “I sat in moody
silence, revolving in reverie without the labour of thought....”</p>

<p>He felt that he was not as others. He found that though
at once proud and gentle, as a boy, his family were sometimes
eyed askance as foreigners. He wished to frequent a public
school; it was deemed unadvisable. The harder side of his
nature began to assert itself. He would triumph over all,
hew down every obstacle. His father suggested the University.
He rejected the offer. Why waste his time in words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
that might prove a school for deeds? “A miserable lot is
mine to feel everything and be nothing.” He was destined,
appointed, reserved. As he grew older these convictions
deepened. “Am I a man, and a man of strong passions and
deep thoughts? And shall I, like a vile beggar, upon my
knees crave the rich heritage that is my own by right?” But
how? The very thought bewildered, oppressed, and embittered
him. “Everything is mysterious, though I have
always been taught the reverse.” In a dangerous moment
he began to lay it down as a principle “that all considerations
must yield to the gratification of my ambition.” Life
without power, and power that he felt deserved, was intolerable.
His father remonstrated. He warned him against
the fatal tyranny of the imagination. “I think,” he said,
“you have talents indeed for anything ... that a rational
being can desire to attain; but you sadly lack judgment.”
The boy replied, “I wish, sir, to influence men.... I am
impressed with a most earnest and determined resolution to
become a practical man. You must not judge of me by my
boyish career. The very feelings that made me revolt at the
discipline of schools will insure my subordination in the world.
I took no interest in their petty pursuits, and their minute
legislation interfered with my extended views.” In answer,
he was admonished that a nature so “headstrong and imprudent”
would lead to situations ridiculous and even dangerous;
that his lack of regulated balance would warp his excellent
instincts. The boy persisted that, if not by deeds yet by
words, he would sway his fellows. “Mix in society,” rejoined
his father, with a shrug of the shoulders, “and I will
answer that you lose your poetic feeling; for in you, as in the
great majority, it is not a creative faculty, originating in a
peculiar organisation, but simply the consequence of a nervous
susceptibility that is common to all.” The youth continued
to fret, and brood, and calculate. He felt method within him
as well as frenzy. In his old age he was once driving past
Bradenham with a lady who knew how happy his home relations
had been. “Ah!” he sighed, “there is where I passed
my miserable youth.”—“Miserable!” she replied; “impossible!
Surely you were happy there.”—“Not then. I was devoured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
by an irresistible ambition which I could not gratify.”<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> It
reminds me of that passage in Swift where the great dean
ascribes the first pricks of ambition, in the career which the
inequalities of his situation had urged, to the rage and mortification
he experienced as a boy in failing to land a big fish.
He grew distracted; for a time he had to inhabit a darkened
room. With the Austins he travelled in Germany and Italy.
The result was <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>—the “Don Juan” of politics.</p>

<p>The circumstances and results of the book I have touched
in the preceding chapter. Disraeli grew ashamed of its
fashionable success. The world was not merely his oyster.
He would elevate and benefit by it. He mixed in society, but
it neither raised his spirits nor slaked his thirst, although it
did help him to see his measure and stature among mankind.
That commerce with the world is the best cure for misjudged
ambition he pressed in his fine address to youth at the
Manchester Athenæum; but ambition itself he regarded as
elevating for man. At the crisis, however, that we have
reached, his ambitions were still unsettled. He began to be
soured and sceptical both of himself, of mankind, and of God.
His spiritual fibre was shaken. His sister, with talents nearly
equal to his, and faith and charity superior, came to his
rescue. She healed his wounds; she ennobled his standard;
she comforted him with her entire belief in his great future.
She restored him to his higher self.</p>

<p>Once more the shadow of ill health fell across the young
Disraeli’s footsteps; this time a very critical malady—a complete
nervous breakdown. He “fainted as he dressed.” He
even had convulsions. He was overwhelmed by strange noises
in his head. “... The falls of Niagara could not overpower
the infernal roaring that I alone heard.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> Travel was prescribed.
He departed for two years from Europe, and mended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
Even at this time, with the spectres of doubt and illness
athwart his way, he could not stifle the secret assurance of
his destiny. I have seen a letter to a friend, who had shared
a financial misadventure, in which he deplores his condition,
but declares that “something within me whispers that one day
I shall be famous. Be assured, if ever that time comes, you
will be the first that I shall remember.”</p>

<p>He returned, found his place, his mission, and his ideals.
But still his discreet family opposed themselves to his
entrance into public life. It was incredible, impossible,
absurd. “So much for the maddest of mad acts, as my uncle
said,” he wrote to his sister on his first return to Parliament.</p>

<p>Every one remembers the story of his meeting with Lord
Melbourne, and his answer, true or not, as to what the premier
could “do for him.” “I wish to be Prime Minister.” At any
rate, Mrs. Austin, in extreme old age, recalled a party at her
house about this period, when the young Disraeli explained
his plans for England, “when I am Prime Minister,” amid
laughter and surprise. “You will see,” he said, bringing his
fist down on the mantelpiece, “I <em>shall</em> be Prime Minister.”
He felt, as he wrote to his sister after attending a great
debate, that “he could floor them all.” His confidence in
himself, like his sister’s in him, was colossal.</p>

<p>So I read his earliest years from his earliest books.
Thenceforward he marched from strength to strength, and
he employed power when he obtained it conscientiously
according to his best lights for the improvement of the people
and the glory of the Empire.</p>

<p>And yet how strange it is, that at the annual gatherings on
his death-day, celebrated by the romance of his memory and his
flower, the successors who, faltering from his footsteps, honour
the good will of his enduring popularity, have never breathed
his name! I can see him smile in the shades; for he found
his party a quagmire, and he left it a township. At all times
he toiled hard and long, though sometimes by fits and starts;
and a study was reserved ready for his visits at Bradenham.
Although in his later years he would sometimes play at
indolence, it was really against the grain. The occasional
air of listlessness which society remarked in his latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
days was the attendant of failing health, and only filmed an
activity that neither age nor illness could overcome. In the
long recess of 1848 he was working over ten hours a day,
rising at five and retiring at nine. In the long session of
1852 he was working considerably more. To the last he read
the classics while he dined. As he lay dying he corrected
his speeches. He never relaxed that infinite interest in
everything and everybody of purport and meaning, which
the French well style “la grande curiosité.”</p>

<p>When he died, amid national mourning, the late Lord
Salisbury, after singling out his unquenchable zeal for the
glory of Britain, lasting to a period when “the gratification
of every possible desire negatived the presumption of any
inferior motive,” adverted to his “patience, his gentleness, his
unswerving and unselfish loyalty to his colleagues and fellow-labourers.”
Indisputably his moral character was high. Without
question he, like Gladstone, raised the tone of parliamentary
life from that of the days when politics were merely a
squabble for place and a toss-up as to “whether England
should be ruled by Tory nobles or by Whig.” His tone may
not always have chimed with certain forms or formulas of
earnestness, but he acted up to his own high standard. “It
was impossible,” said the late Lord Granville, “to deny that
Lord Beaconsfield had played a great part in British History.
No one could deny his rare and splendid gifts and his force of
character.” Character will always appeal to England. “But,”
pursued the orator, after noticing his tolerance and forbearance,
“he undoubtedly possessed the power of appealing to the
imagination, not only of his countrymen, but of foreigners,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> and
that power is not destroyed by death.”</p>

<p>My book opened with Personality, Ideas, and Imagination.
With Imagination, Ideas, and Personality it shall close. They
can turn and change the semblances of material “facts,” for
they abide behind the veil of time and of existence.</p>

weekly, to which Disraeli seems to have contributed as a lad also. Its
foundation brought him to Sir Walter Scott, and to Lockhart, who at
first disdained to be “editor,” but melted when Disraeli assured him that
he would be “Director-general” of a controlling organ. Only a temporary
breach with Murray was caused by Disraeli’s speedy withdrawal from the
concern. But for Lockhart, as a “tenth-rate novelist,” Disraeli expressed

for as attendant in a government office by his master—used to retail
many scraps of such gossip. The young Disraeli’s novels, he averred,

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Like most of the Peelites, Mr. Gladstone was not proof against a
certain air of over-righteous condescension and patronage. Even in the
’sixties he notes in his diary that, meeting Disraeli at a time of trial, he
extended his hand, which was “kindly accepted.” But he honestly
admired his gifts, and in 1859 generously disdained to “bargain” him
“out of the saddle.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Not only convictions, but tactics also. Mr. Gladstone often blamed
actions in others which he afterwards adopted; Disraeli never did. I
subjoin a few instances. In 1852 he blamed Disraeli’s budget-proposal
for repealing half the malt tax; he himself afterwards repealed the whole.
In 1867 he blamed Disraeli’s first introduction of the Reform Act by
resolutions; next year he did the same with his Irish Church Bill. In
1869 he severely blamed Disraeli for resigning without meeting Parliament;
in 1874 he himself followed suit.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Disraeli always insisted on the indispensability of the party system.
As he pointed out of Bolingbroke, so in his own case, the idea of a
“national” party had to be accommodated to conservatism. Gladstone,
too, said of Peel, in 1846, that “to abjure party was impossible” (Morley,
i. 295; <i>cf.</i> Disraeli’s <cite>Life of Lord George Bentinck</cite>, p. 224). After repeal
was carried, Peel gave great offence to his followers—and especially to Mr.
Gladstone—by singling out its illustrious and original champion for praise.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> “As for the Irish bill on which he had turned Peel out, it was one of
the worst of all coercion bills; Peel, with 117 followers, evidently could
not have carried on the Government, and what sense could there have
been in voting for a bad bill in order to retain in office an impossible
Ministry?”—He might have added that the bill—supported some months
earlier by Lord John and Lord G. Bentinck—under protest as only
excusable through urgency, was delayed by Peel to carry the repeal, until
its necessity had vanished.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> He said (1846): “... It was no wonder they (the Protectionists)
regarded themselves as betrayed, and unfortunately it had been the fate
of Sir R. Peel to perform the same operation twice.” From the party standpoint
there was abundant justification. Gladstone in old age declared
that “Disraeli’s brilliant philippics surpassed even their reputation, and
that, under their lash, Peel sat powerless.” <i>Cf.</i> Morley’s “Gladstone,” i.
296, iii. 465. “Dealt with them with a kind of righteous dulness”—“The
Protectionist secession due to three men. Derby contributed prestige;
Bentinck backbone; and Dizzy parliamentary brains.” The real fault
found with Disraeli by his enemies (but afterwards) was that he “did not
care a straw” for Protection. The reader must judge after my two next
chapters.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> It was a sail, however, that could not bear being crossed by contrary

asked by his famous brother to meet his marvellous new friend at dinner.
The company was all young, ambitious, and able; yet all agreed that their
master was “the man in the green trousers.” Perhaps they were not quite

In a speech of 1865 he defines an Estate as “a political body invested
with political power for the government of the country and for the public
good,” and “therefore a body founded upon <em>privilege</em> and not upon
<em>right</em>,” and “in the noblest and properest sense of the term an <em>aristocratic</em>
body.” Under the Plantagenets it was at one time mooted whether the
<em>Law</em> should not be raised into such an “Estate.” He says the same in a
letter of explanation to Lord Malmesbury.</p></div>

equally divided among its proprietors, would only amount to £170 as an
average annual income per head.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> In a speech of 1864, Disraeli said: “... For my own part, believing
that parliamentary government is practically impossible without two
organised parties, that without them it would be the most contemptible
and corrupt system which could be devised, I always regret anything that
may damage the just influence of either of the great parties in the
State.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> The great depression of 1847–51 was not wholly caused by the
fiscal change. It was largely due to reaction after the railway mania, as
Disraeli pointed out in a speech of 1879. It was followed by a rise in
wages, due, not to Free Trade, but to the large imports of newly discovered
gold; and by an increased purchasing power which <em>was</em> due to Peel’s
large abatements of the tariff.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> It should be borne in mind that Disraeli sometimes employs the
words “aristocracy” and “democracy” to mean the order of aristocrats
and democrats, sometimes to mean the systems of exclusion and inclusion,
sometimes to mean the government by the best and by the miscellaneous,
and oftener as indicating elements in our Constitution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> At that time, under the full spell of the analogy which the age of
Walpole presented, he believed that triennial parliaments and the
ballot might redress the balance of constitutional power and foil the
oligarchs who had baffled the people by espousing a popular cry. In
1852, however, he said, with regard to those proposals brought forward by
Mr. Hume: “... He did not object to them, but he saw no necessity to
adopt them. His objections to the latter were distinctly founded on the
limits of the franchise which the settlement of 1832 had not sufficiently
extended, but ... if they had universal suffrage they came to a new
constitution—a constitution commonly called the ‘Sovereignty of the
People,’ but that is not the Constitution of England; for, wisely modified
as that monarchy may be, the Constitution of England is the sovereignty
of Queen Victoria.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_82" href="#FNanchor_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> The rise in wages and prices about 1851 was mainly due not to
“Free Trade,” but to the influx of newly discovered gold. In 1842,
when Peel was revising the tariff, bread was actually cheaper than it had
been for many years previously, or till 1849 afterwards. In 1851 corn had
sunk to about 40<i>s.</i>, nearly 8<i>s.</i> lower than Peel had contemplated as
possible. The immediate results of repeal were not the cheapening
of bread; but the sudden cheapening of commodities <em>was</em> effected by
Peel’s revision of the tariff. In 1851, however, all other agricultural
produce but wheat was at fair prices, and Disraeli then wrote, “It is
possible that agriculture may flourish without a high price of wheat or
without producing any” (<cite>Correspondence</cite>, p. 262).</p></div>

name. It was deluded by vague promises of actual benefit under the new
system. Peel even asserted that corn would never fall under forty-eight
shillings per quarter.

It is often forgotten that in 1843 Peel favoured a preferential tariff for
Canada, and that both he and Gladstone were then for Canadian “retaliation”
on America.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> In the Preface to <cite>Lothair</cite> he says:—“The sceptical efforts of the
discoveries of science, and the uneasy feeling that they cannot co-exist
with our old religious convictions, have their origin in the conviction that
the general body who have suddenly become conscious of these physical
truths are not so well acquainted as is desirable with the past history of
man. Astonished by their unprepared emergence from ignorance to a
certain degree of information, their amazed intelligence takes refuge in the
theory of what is conveniently called Progress, and every step in scientific
discovery seems further to remove them from the path of primæval
inspiration. But there is no fallacy so flagrant as to suppose that the
modern ages have the peculiar privilege of scientific discovery, or that
they are distinguished as the epochs of the most illustrious inventions.
No one for a moment can pretend that printing is so great a discovery as
writing, or algebra as language. What are the most brilliant of our
chemical discoveries compared with the invention of fire and the metals?
It is a vulgar belief that our astronomical knowledge dates only from the
recent century, when it was rescued from the monks who imprisoned
Galileo. But Hipparchus, who lived before our Divine Master ...
discovered the precession of the equinoxes; and Copernicus ... avows
himself as only the champion of Pythagoras.... Even the most modish
schemes of the day on the origin of things ... will be found mainly to
rest on the atom of Epicurus and the monad of Thales. Scientific, like
spiritual truth, has ever from the beginning been descending from heaven
to man....” So, too, in a speech of 1861, dealing both with science
and the higher criticism, “Epicurus was, I apprehend, as great a man as
Hegel; but it was not Epicurus who subverted the religion of Olympus.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> This idea is, among other speeches, worked out in that delivered at
Amersham, December 4, 1860, where he says: “The parish is one of
the strongest securities for local government, and on local government
mainly depends our political liberty.” He points out that the Church is
not oligarchical, and does not claim those exclusive privileges which the
Nonconformists often do. It is national in its comprehensive ties with
the country and its inclusiveness. The abolition of the parish system
would alone prove a national and social upheaval.</p></div>

as retentive as Gladstone’s. In his famous Address to the Crown of 1864,
he was sharply blamed for referring to “the just influence of England
being lowered” in the extraordinary tangle of alternate brag and whimper
that attended the Government’s action in the Danish embroilment. This
language was solemnly declared “unprecedented since the great days of
the Norths and the Foxes.” But Disraeli instantly proved that Fox
himself had used language in his own Address far more violent and
censorious of the Ministry in 1846. So, again, on at least two occasions
when the phrases “political morality” and “political infamy” were
bandied for partisan purposes, he effectively hurled back the taunts in the
teeth of their inventors, and refuted present profession by past conduct.
When Palmerston again twitted him, in 1846, he received a reminder
which brought home the jaunty service of seven successive Administrations,
and all this, though he never attacked small game, and never any
“unless he had been first assailed.” In the earlier numbers of <cite>The Press</cite>
are many most interesting historical instances of how “principles” may
be confused with “measures,” when the latter have to be relinquished in
office from the practical duty of <em>carrying on the Government</em>, while at
the same time the former can be developed in other directions when
the national condemnation of the particular measure is deliberate. So Fox
had acted towards Catholic emancipation, Russell towards the Appropriation
Bill, the Whigs in the ’forties towards the Income Tax, and Disraeli
in 1852 towards “Protection.” So, he argued in many previous utterances,
the principle must now be followed by relieving the land, now
placed under unfair conditions of competition, of its burdens.</p></div>

allowing Russia to expand where she was entitled or compelled by war, or

Britain.

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> Of the many passages that may be read in this connection, including
that fine ironical one of the Feast of Tabernacles in <cite>Tancred</cite>,
paralleled by that about “Moses Lump” in Heine, and the telling chapter
in the <cite>Life of Lord George Bentinck</cite>, I will only cite one less familiar from
<cite>Alroy</cite>: “... All was silent: alone the Hebrew prince stood, amid
the regal creation of the Macedonian captains. Empires and dynasties
flourish and pass away; the proud metropolis becomes a solitude, the
conquering kingdom even a desert; but Israel still remains, still a
descendant of the most ancient kings breathed amid these royal ruins,
and still the eternal sun could never arise without gilding the towers of
living Jerusalem.” This (with its after-irony of “Alroy’s” seizure by the
Kourdish bandits) may be compared with the satire in which Disraeli
encountered Mr. Newdegate’s appeals to “prophecy:” “... They
have survived the Pharaohs, they have survived the Cæsars, they have
survived the Antonines and the Seleucidæ, and I think they will survive
the arguments of the right honourable member....” Mr. Morley tells
that Mr. Gladstone said that Disraeli asserted that only those nations
that behaved well to the Jews prospered. Disraeli, in saying so, however,
only repeated a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dictum</i> of Frederick the Great.</p></div>

monopoly,” said: “... No prince, probably, that has ever lived has

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
